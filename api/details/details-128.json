Because it has a Jet fire ignition, this gas grill only requires the use of one hand to light up. The power output of the four primary burners is 13.6 kW, linked to one another. This ensures that even if one of the burners is extinguished by the wind, the others will continue to function normally. You will discover an additional burner on the table on the left side, which you may use to create sauces or side dishes.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671503089637.jpeg","content_id":"341","author_id":"8","release_time":"2022-12-20 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-20 10:25:49","update_time":"2022-12-20 16:44:59","entered_by":"admin","topping":"0","score":"","author_introduction":"A senior writer focused on selecting and writing articles around the best goods for household, finance, tech and health.","author_head_portrait":"/uploadsImg/1671161773831.jpeg","author_name":"Jennifer Garcia","category_recommend_list":[{"id":50,"article_id":"5","one_type":"18","two_type":"20","title":"Best Solar Pool Covers ","main_title":"The 5 Best Solar Pool Covers Of 2022","keyword":"Swim 12 Mil Solar Pool Blanket, Sun2Solar 1200 Series Solar Pool Cover, Blue Wave NS120","description":"Solar pool covers, also known as solar blankets, are a type of swimming pool cover that utilizes the energy from the sun in order to keep swimming pools at a comfortable temperature.

Ignition is provided by an immediate JETFIRE ignition system, which fires the primary burners with a jet of flame easily and consistently. Cast iron frying grids coated in porcelainized enamel will help you achieve the ideal sear. </p><p><br></p><p>The heat is provided by four stainless steel burners, each with ergonomic knobs that make adjustments simple and an inbuilt temperature indicator that keeps track of the current setting. The sturdy wheels of this grill make it possible for it to be moved to wherever the action is, and the easy-to-fold side shelves, which come equipped with tool racks and a bottle opener, guarantee the <b>Freestyle</b> will accommodate both your lifestyle and your available space.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+\tHeats up rapidly.</p><p>+\tThe livery of gray graphite looks incredibly slick.</p><p>+\tGuarantee for ten years.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>- No side burner.</p><p>- There were some chilly spots in front of the grill.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Key Specs</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>· <b>Side Burners:</b> \t\t0</p><p>· <b>Main Burners:</b> \t\t4</p><p>· <b>Main Burner BTU:</b> \t38,000</p><p>· <b>Dimensions:</b> \t\t60.5 x 52 x 25 in.</p><p>· <b>Primary Cooking Space:</b> 427.5 sq. in.</p><p>· <b>Burner Material:</b> \tStainless steel</p><p>· <b>Weight:</b> \t\t114 lbs.</p><p>· <b>Burner Warranty:</b> \t5 years + 50% off until the 10th year</p><p>· <b>Product Warranty:</b> \t10 years (limited)</p><p><br></p><p>Despite having a more affordable price tag, the Napoleon Freestyle 425 has a sophisticated graphite grey porcelain enamel finish, giving the impression that the device is much higher quality. The grill features four burners and a pretty decently sized cooking surface, sufficient to handle up to 27 burgers simultaneously. In addition to the three hooks that are provided for hanging your barbeque items, it also features two good-sized side tables that may be used for meal preparation and keeping dishes.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are through using the grill, you may make storage of it more convenient by folding the tables under it. The stand has doors that softly shut and robust wheels so it can be moved about the yard easily. The doors encircle the gas bottle, concealing the unsightly hoses and worn-out gas bottles. To put the Napoleon Freestyle <b>425</b> through its paces, we began our examination from the very first step.</p><p><br></p><p>We put together the grill from scratch, keeping track of the amount of time it took and evaluating how straightforward the directions were to follow. When it came time for the culinary portion of the exam, we roasted a whole chicken in addition to grilling steaks, burgers, and veggies. We also cooked sausages. Instead of using the rotisserie attachment offered separately, we decided to employ the indirect grilling approach.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Design</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Napoleon Freestyle 425 has a fantastic livery that is graphite grey in color. The porcelain enamel gives it a wonderfully high-quality look and feels, contributing to its impressive appearance. A further advantage is that, in contrast to the black and stainless steel finishes seen on other gas grills, it is less likely to show greasy fingerprints. Because the corners are rounded, you won't have to worry about accidentally running into them. The sturdy wheels attached to the base make it simple to maneuver in any environment.</p><p><br></p><p>It has a smaller area than some of the larger premium versions, enabling it to weigh less without making it flimsier. The cook box and the lid have a hefty weight to them, giving the impression that they were constructed with quality materials. Because it comes with a ten-year guarantee, it's clear that Napoleon is confident in its ability to withstand the test of time.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Napoleon Freestyle 425 features four burners made of stainless steel, each of which may be operated independently. This makes it possible to cook food both directly and indirectly. The warming rack is rather spacious and provides additional room for cooking items that may be done in a hurry. When using this grill, there will be no need to worry about everyone being hungry since the actual cooking surface is rather spacious and has enough for up to 26 burgers.</p><p><br></p><p>The temperature monitor has a classic design, and the cast iron porcelainized enamel cooking grids contain Napoleon's signature wavy sear marks. The firebox made of aluminum is intended to provide an effect similar to that of a convection oven. In addition, the right-hand side of the folding table has three hooks that may be used to hang your various tools, making them easily accessible.</p><p><br></p><p>In contrast to the huge Weber barbecues, there are not many extra attachments that can be purchased to permit alternative cooking techniques; nevertheless, it is possible to purchase a rotisserie and a cast-iron charcoal tray, both of which are features that we enjoy the concept of having. This attempts to provide that authentic barbecue flavor, and we are certain that it will be warmly received by charcoal grilling purists who want the ease of use offered by gas grills yet long for the smoky flavor associated with charcoal grilling.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Performance</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The only significant challenge we had was making the ignition system function properly. After a few attempts, we could keep the burners lit without any problems. However, after that, we could never replicate the issue, so it's possible that we needed more practice.</p><p><br></p><p>We did see that the temperature decreased very rapidly when we raised the cover of the grill but that it soon climbed again when the lid was placed back on the grill. The grill heated up extremely quickly. We observed a colder area at the front of the grill, which may be challenging if you want to cook all 27 burgers simultaneously.</p><p><br></p><p>Aside from that, it did a good job of cooking everything, but since it burns so vigorously, it could take a little effort to get the temps exactly right. On the other hand, our steaks came out perfectly seared, and we cooked a full chicken using indirect heat for about an hour and twenty minutes total.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Maintenance</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The tables collapse for convenient stowage when not in use. Once assembled, the full-size grill was surprisingly lightweight and simple. When you fold the tables down, the width is reduced from 55 inches to 33 inches; this is not an insignificant difference if you move it into a limited space like a garage or a tiny storage area. We did some research online and discovered a couple of deals that included a free cover in the grill price and found that Napoleon sells a special cover for this model that you can use if you need to store it outdoors.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671503134694.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The manufacturer recommends using a brass wire brush to wash the inside of the cooking box and the area below the lid. A plastic putty knife should also be used to scrape the sear plates. When working with porcelain, putty knives or scrapers made of plastic should be used to prevent chipping or to scratch the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>The drip pan may be removed from below the grill to make cleaning it simpler; Napoleon recommends doing this after every fourth or fifth time the barbecue is used. Only water that has had soapily added should be used to clean the control panel; abrasives and abrasive cloths of any kind should be avoided.</p><p><br></p><p>After cleaning, Reena Mistry of Flogas urges users that they don't forget one key thing, which is to cover up their equipment. \"End your cleaning frenzy by covering up your equipment,\" she says. If you do so, it will remain in the best condition possible until the time comes when you wish to use it again. This will assist in protecting your barbeque from all of the elements that Mother Nature may throw at it. Even though it may seem like a fussy chore and is sometimes forgotten, it is essential.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Price</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Weber Spirit II E-310 3-Burner Liquid Propane Grill comes at a price comparable to that of the Napoleon Freestyle 425, which has the same small feel but a somewhat bigger cooking surface despite having just three burners. Both grills run on liquid propane. In addition, it provides a smoker box so that the food may have that 'barbecued' taste.  In contrast, the guarantee on the Napoleon is good for a whole decade, while the one on the other product is only valid for three years.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>User Reviews</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The grill was easy to put up and cook on, as was noted by one of the reviewers, who said, \"This gives me comfort to grill for friends and family since it is trustworthy and hassle-free.\"</p><p><br></p><p>One customer, however, was underwhelmed by the 425's capacity to keep heat: \"It doesn't remain hot, extremely hard to achieve a decent char on food particularly if using more than one third of the grill area,\" the customer said.</p><p><br></p><p>The burners light up without effort, and the heat distribution seems very consistent. The cooking grates are substantial in both thickness and weight. The warming rack is enormous, and you can fit more than a little hamburger bun from the grocery store at once.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Competitors</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Char-Broil Performance 475 4-Burner Gas Grill comes at a very little cheaper price, with a cooking surface that is comparably big and has the extra benefit of a side burner. However, it is not possible to compete with Napoleon's 10-year guarantee since it only comes with a warranty of five years on the burner and just one year on all the other components.</p><p><br></p><p>The Dyna-Glo 4-Burner Gas Grill may be purchased for approximately two hundred dollars less than the Napoleon. Again, it provides a sufficient amount of power and area for cooking, but it has a limited warranty, and replacement parts may be difficult to get. You could regret not shelling out the additional several hundred dollars in a year or two.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are pressed for cash, the RevoAce 4-Burner Gas Grill is an option that costs even less. It also comes with a side burner, but although being quite well-built, it has a little unstable feel about it, and there have been complaints of problems with the ignition. Again, you won't be able to anticipate Napoleon's 10-year guarantee if you get it at this price.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>What Experts Say</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>We inquired about Ross Bearman's thoughts on the Napoleon Freestyle 425 by contacting him. According to what he had to say, \"The Napoleon Freestyle 425 gives lots of variety, with the option of direct and indirect grilling, which enables the chef to conjure up anything from steak and burgers to luscious entire birds and joints of meat.\" Investing in a rotisserie is a good idea if one of one's favorite things to do is entire roast chicken on a grill since it ensures that the chicken will always be cooked to perfection and will have a crispy skin.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671503145512.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Would It Be A Good Idea To Get The Napoleon Freestyle 425?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Napoleon Freestyle 425 is an excellent value for the money, coming in at a third of the price of other luxury models despite having a 10-year guarantee, solid construction, outstanding appearance, a wide cooking surface, and four burners.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"427","score":"4","amazon_adv":[{"id":427,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525896789.jpeg","title":"Napoleon Freestyle 425","original_price":"$599.99","actual_price":"$599.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3D8i593","description":""}]}]}
