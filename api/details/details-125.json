A fire pit is a wonderful way to spend more time outside, and it can incorporate this fantastic design into an entertainment area located on a terrace or in a garden.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: Key Specs</h2><p><br></p><p><b>Source of heat:</b> Wood </p><p><b>size:</b> 27\" x 17\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 38 pounds</p><p><b>Body:</b> Stainless Steel</p><p><b>Warranty:</b> Lifetime</p><p><br></p><p>The Yukon has garnered a reputation not just for the excellence of its appearance but also for the fact that it places a greater emphasis on the flames, resulting in less smoke produced. Users have also expressed their appreciation for the drum's big capacity. </p><p><br></p><p>If you are unhappy with the functionality of your Yukon product, you have the opportunity to return it within 30 days and receive a full refund, as well as a free return label. This is a safe method for creating a warm and comforting environment outside in the fresh air. The business is so satisfied with the quality of its product that they give this guarantee.</p><p><br></p><p>There are other choices available, especially if you are interested in a model smaller than the Solo Stove Yukon, located at the more expensive end of the fire pit collection sold by Solo Stove. The Solo Stove Bonfire, with a diameter of 19.5 inches, and the Solo Stove Ranger, with a diameter of 15 inches, are two alternatives to consider if the larger 27-inch model is too much fire pit for your requirements. </p><p><br></p><p>We recommend looking at our round-up of the finest outdoor heaters to discover a model that will disperse heat over a greater area if the area in question requires an additional dose of warmth.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: Design</h2><p><br></p><p>It's reasonable to assume that customers of the Yukon stove will have strong opinions on its appearance. This fire pit may serve as the focal point of the arrangement for certain people. Others may have the impression that the drum of a dryer has been removed and positioned upright as if someone had done so deliberately. You wouldn't be completely off base there, but we do know this: the fact that the Yukon is composed of stainless steel indicates that it will be able to withstand the weather well.</p><p><br></p><p>After a very intense fire, the stainless finish will be quite simple to clean with water. Solo Stove is quick to note that one of its appealing features is the one-of-a-kind coloring and patina that develops as a result of frequent heating. If sufficient room is around all sides of the Solo Stove Yukon, it may also be installed in an underground fire pit. The required amount of clearance is between four and six inches.</p><p><br></p><p>The Yukon is segmented into layers to ensure that the fuel you use undergoes the most efficient and effective burning process possible. Your fuel is placed on an ingeniously perforated base plate, and the burn chamber is located at the very top of the device. </p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671447440401.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Underneath is ashes pan, which has two purposes: it protects the ground below from the heat, and it also assists in maintaining the separation between your combustible materials and the byproducts of their combustion. Compared to other kinds of fire pits, the Solo Stove's ventilation design reportedly results in a far higher percentage of wood being reduced to ash, making cleanup a lot simpler.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: Performance</h2><h2></h2><p>This structure has an ingenious airflow arrangement. The Yukon intended to suck oxygen via the ring of perforations on the bottom of its outer layer, which supplies ample oxygenation to the bottom of the fire, blazing on a moving platform around halfway up the primary chambers in the way of a conventional furnace.</p><p><br></p><p>The Yukon has a secondary air chamber all the way around its outside borders, so it can also pull air from the top through the openings there. It allows for a subsequent burn, igniting most of the smoke generated by the initial combustion and leading to a larger flame and less distracting carbon clouds. </p><p>That is unquestionably a beneficial thing, especially in areas with more wind or a dense population, and it looks wonderful.</p><p><br></p><p>The ashes pan is a good addition to the fireplace since it separates the embers and logs from the byproducts of the fire, which results in a cleaner flame; nevertheless, it is not the simplest thing to wash out. The recommendation made by Solo Stove is that you turn the entire thing inverted to get the ash off, which may be a more feasible approach to employ on the Yukon's younger cousins: this thing weighs 38 pounds and is large with it, so make sure to find a friend for help.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671447451494.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>However, the fact that it is so large works to its benefit in terms of fuel efficiency. Because the burn chamber of this fire pit can accommodate logs up to 420 centimeters in length, you won't have to resort to using an axe to perform the kind of preparation that is necessary for certain other types of fire pits.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: User Benefits</h2><p><br></p><p>Fire pits almost always take up a position in the exact center of the activity. They are something to gather around and take pleasure in. The Solo Stove was designed specifically for that purpose; it may be used for this purpose even if you do not presently have a fire going, provided that you also purchase the Yukon Lid. It might be pricey, but it's perfect for almost every circumstance for a variety of reasons, including the following:</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that there is very little smoke is an extremely appealing quality; the fewer times you have to cough, the more time you will have to spend resting by the fire. If you have an effective burning mechanism, you should be able to get the maximum amount of heat from the fuel without having to do an excessive amount of preparation. Because it is made of stainless steel, it ought to be incredibly long-lasting and simple to clean when using the appropriate cleaning tools.</p><p><br></p><p>It has an exquisite look and would be a wonderful central focus in your garden if you were to install it there.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: price</h2><p><br></p><p>In its current iteration, the Yukon is more than capable of maintaining a healthy fire. Still, in comparison to the far more affordable Amazon Basic Geometrical Fire Pit, it has a sense of being unfinished. The Yukon Stand, which you can purchase for $89, further helps to prevent heat transmission to the ground, which makes this product suitable for use on deck or grassland. If you want the complete experience, you'll probably like to pick up a few more.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671447463852.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The next option is the wire mesh Shield, which retails for $199 and may be installed on the top ring of the pit to deflect stray sparks and embers. In addition, there is no coverage offered as a normal inclusion; thus, the Shelter, which costs $59, is an optional extra; alternatively, you may choose the steel material Yukon Cover, which costs $119.99. The latter not only serves as a tabletop whenever the firepit is not in use but also conceals the main room of the structure.</p><p><br></p><h2>Solo Stove by Yukon: User Reviews</h2><p><br></p><p>The reviews on this page are almost universally positive, with the Yukon receiving 4.7-5 stars on Amazon and 4.9 out of 5 ratings on the company's website. People who have used this product have pointed out a few noteworthy features. </p><p><br></p><p>Smaller flames won't be able to pull in nearly enough air to initiate the secondary burn at the top of the chimney since the smoke-reducing feature of its air circulation works when you have a larger fire blazing.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, although it emits a significant amount of heat, most of that heat is directed upward, with the walls of the main pit functioning as somewhat of an insulator. This is an issue that the Tiki Label Fire Pit circumvents. One of the reviewers stated that the most significant benefit was that you do not even smell like such a wood fire after the evening.\" Which is a great thing.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671447523706.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>A stove that is left uncovered has the propensity to accumulate rainwater, and it is hard to empty ash once the cooking process is over. These are not particularly desirable features. According to the majority of reviews, this isn't the full package, despite the fact that the heat it produces is pleasing and the flames it produces are remarkable. Nearly everyone recommends purchasing the optional additions, which dramatically drive up the cost of the product.</p><p><br></p><h2>Should you buy Solo Stove by Yukon?</h2><p><br></p><p>This product has a lot going for it, including the fact that it is stylish and contemporary, long-lasting, and has earned many excellent reviews. The creation of heat and the relatively low amount of smoke produced are other important factors to consider. </p><p><br></p><p>Not every patio is a good fit for this fire pit because it isn't as portable as other of Solo Stove's smaller fire pits, but it will add a warm and welcoming ambiance to the right space.</p><p><br></p><p>When considering whether or not to buy this fire pit, one of the key considerations may be one's financial situation. The first part of the package is a fire pit, which can be precisely what you need if all you want is a wood burner that generates heat for your patio so that you can socialize around it. </p><p><br></p><p>Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion and rust, so a cover might not even be necessary. If you want to put in convenient accessories, the cost will increase. However, it is worth watching out for the company's \"Backyard Bundle\" for a few extra dollars to save if you are interested in purchasing it.</p><p><br></p><h2>How we tested Solo Stove by Yukon?</h2><p><br></p><p>Does the Solo Stove's outside heat up? I kindled a blaze and allowed it to burn for half an hour. After that, I took the external temperature of the Solo Stove using a laser thermometer. The stove top was approximately 120 degrees Fahrenheit, but the bottom was a chilly 70 degrees. The highest part of the Stove suddenly reached 230 degrees. The top portion of the Stove should thus be avoided when a fire is in progress.</p><p><br></p><p>The second objective was the ease with which one may prepare food on the Solo Stove. The grate from my charcoal barbecue worked wonderfully in the Solo Stove. I heated water and toasted bread to evaluate the possibilities of cooking with fire. For me, using a single stove was similar to using a fire pit to prepare meals. It's not easy, but it is certainly possible to do. Particularly if, instead of using open flames, you first reduce wood to embers to use as a cooking medium.</p><p><br></p><p>How well does the Solo Stove keep up if left outside for eight months? In a word, quite good. My Solo Stove is protected from the elements and has been kept outside. While the Stove itself appears to be brand new, the rain cover has seen better days.</p><p><br></p><p>The rain cover is not torn; it's simply grimy. The fire pit generates little smoke. Your eyes and nose won't moisten or congest from sneezing as you enjoy a campfire. The minimal amount of white ash left at the bottom after a fire also makes cleanup a breeze.</p><p><br></p><p>The primary drawback of Solo Stove is the price. It's pricey at roughly $500. The Solo Stove's pricing is on pace with other smokeless options like Bree, while a fire pit will cost you far less to construct.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"424","score":"4.5","amazon_adv":[{"id":424,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525748122.jpeg","title":"Solo Stove Yukon","original_price":"$499.99","actual_price":"$499.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3TvhyTP","description":""}]}]}
