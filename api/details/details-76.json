In addition, a privacy shutter can be used to hide the camera from prying eyes. Our top pick is the Insta360 Link, which, for $299, includes a 4K camera placed on a 3-axis gimbal that allows it to swivel and pivot to follow you as you move around a room.

The Logitech C911 Pro, which we tested here, can be purchased for a suggested retail price of $110/£110. It's more powerful sibling, the Logitech Brio 4K, is almost twice as expensive. Despite this, they appear to be the same and function similarly, as the latter's 4K resolution is unusable for most video conferencing services.</p><p>Although the C922 Pro doesn't have quite the same luxury aesthetic as the Brio and lacks the webcam's pretty poor privacy cover, it does come with a little tripod that allows you to place it in a more discreet location than right on top of your computer screen. The C922 Pro is equipped with a universal display mount, automated focus and luminance, a 76-degree view field (less than the Brio's 90), and 1080p Full HD at 30 frames each second or 720p HD at a smoother 60fps.</p><p>The Logitech C922 Pro Stream is the greatest overall webcam because it can do so much. Even if it's not 4K like others on this list, it's still a strong contender because of the reasonable pricing. To begin, it's made by Logitech, so you know it's well-made and will produce great images. Even though it only records 1080p at 30fps or 720p at 60fps, this webcam's optics and processing give it the potential to outperform its competitors in terms of image quality.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"358","score":"4.5","subtitle":"Best webcams","amazon_adv":[{"id":358,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671510019731.jpeg","title":"Logitech ","original_price":"$99.95","actual_price":" $66.99","specifications":"C922 Pro Stream","link":"https://amzn.to/3LVSe6J","description":""}]},{"id":433,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>2.

All this and more is available with the Logitech Brio Ultra HD Webcam, supported by top-notch software upgrades. Thus, it is well suited for video conferencing and live broadcasts and is adaptable and automated for convenience in any setting. Of course, it won't break the bank, but it's packed with useful extras, and we consider it among the best webcams(opens in a separate tab) on the market.</p><p>The high pixel count of this webcam means that it can digitally zoom in on a specific area, which is useful if you want to focus on a certain person in a group photo, for example. Autofocus and RightLight's patented light adjustments both ensure that the end product is sharp and well-balanced with minimal input from the user. The high-quality construction and expert polish make it an attractive option for temporary relocation.</p><p>It's important to note that this webcam's 4K broadcast maxes out at 30 frames per second, but you can switch to 1080p for a silky smooth 60 frames per second if necessary. The Logitech Brio Ultra HD Webcam provides the highest quality video in its class. If you've been using an HD webcam, or the webcam that comes standard on most laptops, the 4K lens will be a huge upgrade. Compared to other webcams, the Logitech Brio Ultra HD Webcam is in another league. You'll be treated to a picture that's as crisp and clean as glass, thanks to the 4K resolution.</p><p><br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"359","score":"4.5","subtitle":"null","amazon_adv":[{"id":359,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671510161582.jpeg","title":" Logitech ","original_price":"$149.99 ","actual_price":"$138.45","specifications":"Brio Ultra HD Webcam","link":"https://amzn.to/3dXFK2c","description":""}]},{"id":434,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>3.

At just $329, the PanaCast 20 is a lot more wallet-friendly than the PanaCast (at $550) and PanaCast 50 ($1,315), both designed for usage in conference rooms. That's a lot to pay for something that can't compete with cheaper options like the $199.99 Razer Kiyo Pro and the $129.99 Poly Studio P5 regarding audio and image quality. We prefer other models, but if you need a webcam that can handle video chats for one person or a whole conference room, the PanaCast 20 is a good option to consider.</p><p>The camera has a wide-angle lens with a 90-degree field of view and an aperture of f/2.25 in addition to a 13-megapixel 1/3.2-inch sensor. The maximum possible resolution for live video streaming is 4K, and the maximum supported frame rate is 30 frames per second. To capture sound, the PanaCast 20 has three microphones—two on either side of the lens and one on the top plate.</p><p>The PanaCast 20 departs from the standard plastic design with its all-metal construction and sleek, soap-bar shape. The camera may be placed on tripods and other desktop stands thanks to a standard 1/4in the thread, and now a fold-out monitor stand with rubberized edges is integrated into the base. The USB-C connector is located at the back, vertically.

This camera is a serious contender with an intelligent build, automatic AI framing, stereo microphones, and Full HD video recording at a fluid 60 frames per second.Despite the name suggesting it is a screen for live streams, we think it is a great option for remote workers who want to improve their image (and audio quality) without having to spend excessively on a 4K webcam for whom the extra pixels are squandered on HD-only conferencing platforms.</p><p>Logitech wants you to believe this is an excellent streaming camera (opens in a new tab). Even StreamCams packaging boasts that it provides \"the ultimate experience for streamers,\" but you shouldn't be fooled. Regrettably, Logitech's marketing staff has gotten in the way because the StreamCam is not a viable webcam if you want to make money streaming online as a side gig.</p><p>According to the marketing, the StreamCams ability to flip around and shoot high-definition video in portrait mode, perfect for Instagram stories, is a major selling point. While this is great for content providers like YouTubers who want to shoot black-and-white stories, it's impossible to live-stream an Instagram post from a webcam (just a smartphone).
