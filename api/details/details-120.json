If this seems like something that would appeal to you, keep reading. </p><p><br/></p><p>The new Vac 2 Pro, which costs $449.99, features an oscillating mopping technology that scrubs and allows it to vacuum and clean floors simultaneously. In addition, it is equipped with clever 3D obstacle avoidance, enabling it to complete the task without becoming sidetracked by anything like a pair of shoes. It does not mop your carpets.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 pro: Key Specs</h2><p><br/></p><p><b>Model: </b>vac-2 pro</p><p><b>Maps: </b>SLAM visuals nav</p><p><b>Cleaning: </b>200-3000 pa suction, mopping</p><p><b>Obstacle avoidance: </b>3D </p><p><b>Clearance: </b>9-16mm</p><p><b>Suction: </b>auto-boost</p><p><br/></p><p>Competing head-on with some more renowned companies, the Vac 2 is an audacious new vacuum cleaner which seeks to entice you with a highly enticing collection of functions. And it does it by ditching Lidar in favour of VSLAM technology and employing an oscillating mopping mechanism in an effort to outdo the competition.</p><p><br/></p><p>Though I applaud the diffusion of cutting-edge innovations into more reasonably priced robot vacuum cleaners, I must caution that novelty does not necessarily guarantee superiority. There is a distinction between change and improvement, and I know that many manufacturers confuse the two. While I agree that VSLAM holds much promise, having witnessed it in action on a different &#34;cheap&#34; robot vacuum cleaner has convinced me to sing the praises of Lidar technology even more loudly.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Vac 2 Pro is equipped with a brand-new oscillating mopping mechanism that effectively washes your floors and a smart carpet-detecting feature that keeps it from soaking rugs. What&#39;s more, the vacuum can now avoid shoes, pet food bowls, and other potential snares with the help of a 3D collision avoidance capability made possible by newly installed sensors.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671438036221.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Like earlier Yeedi robotic vacuums, this product features a top-mounted camera that can map the space and find its way around. This lets you personalise tasks and make them more effective by letting you choose the order in which they&#39;re cleaned. The Vac 2 Pro is similar to the Vac Station in that you can vacuum or mop at the same time; the dustbin is concealed behind the vacuum&#39;s lid, and the water tank is concealed within the unit&#39;s back. The Vac 2 Pro has 3000pa of suction, much like the Vac Station.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 Pro: Design</h2><p><br/></p><p>Since the original Roomba made its rounds, the robotic vacuum cleaner hasn&#39;t changed its appearance in almost a decade. Considering the circular chassis&#39;s usefulness for dodging obstacles of product, it&#39;s easy to see why the designers didn&#39;t see any reason to alter it. Like the Roborock, the Vac 2 has a white matte surface over a circular plastic container. When I discovered that I could lift the cover at the top to see the Power switch and the trash bin, I was concerned that I had indeed purchased a knockoff.</p><p><br/></p><p>After observing the camera that faces upwards on the top of the robotic vacuum cleaner and the underside of the device, it appears to be a more distinctive piece of equipment.&#34; </p><p><br/></p><p>To my knowledge, we are dealing with a device that attempts to create a 360-degree map of its surroundings using a fish-eye lens. It&#39;s a novel concept, but it won&#39;t be capable of avoiding obstacles like wires or socks as the Trifo Lucy did. But I noticed that I could remove the back half of the Vac 2 Pro, and I know that it has IR sensors all around the casing to help it avoid collisions.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671438047266.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>As far as I can see, its only use is to retain the module of the oscillating mopping system and act as a decorative accent. The underside of Vac 2 Pro features wheels that you can adjust in height, a removable roller brush which you can clean thoroughly, and cliff sensors located close to the edge of the box. Moreover, I found a connection between the single corner brush and a carpet-detecting sensor next to the rotating base. The two lids of the trash can were likewise a wonderful sight to behold.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 Pro: Performance</h2><p><br/></p><p>This product has four different suction settings, with the highest reaching up to 3,000Pa. This test aims to determine whether or not it is possible to let the vacuum roam the home while you are asleep. </p><p><br/></p><p>The Quiet Mode will generate noise that is somewhere around the average of 45 decibels, which is acceptable so long as the robotic vacuum cleaner does not clean the bedrooms but only the rest of the home. The following suction level, level 2, increases to a mean of 43 dB, which is noisier but still tolerable during the day. The following suction level, level 3, can grow slightly louder, peaking at 53 dB, but it is still tolerable during the day.</p><p><br/></p><p>As I discussed in the section on the Mobile Application, it is possible to mark some areas of the map as &#34;No-Go&#34; zones, meaning that the vacuum cleaner robot will not enter certain areas.</p><p><br/></p><p>And the fact that it is done via the app is a relief to me because I wouldn&#39;t say I like the magnet bands that have to be placed within the rooms to use non-Lidar devices, so it&#39;s nice, not required. In terms of Area cleaning, you have the option of selecting a certain room to be cleaned or subdividing the larger space into several smaller areas; however, you do not have the capability to manoeuvre the robotic vacuum around manually. Despite this, I was pleasantly delighted to see that you can program the gadget to operate for numerous iterations in a row at the same time.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671438058845.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>It is conceivable for this product, just like the vast majority of many other robotic vacuums on the market, to become entangled on a wire or to place itself in a situation from which it cannot escape. However, it is still one of the most adaptable machines of its kind since it is not &#34;afraid&#34; to approach close to an item. Because of this, the product I tested never required any assistance from a human throughout all of my trials.</p><p><br/></p><p>As soon as the Vac 2 Pro&#39;s battery hits 10%, it will begin searching for the docking station, and as you may have read in part titled Navigation, the feature that detects objects will be disabled at this time. Regardless of this, the gadget will make its way to the charging station in a short amount of time without wandering in the area.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 Pro: Battery Life</h2><p><br/></p><p>According to the manufacturer, the Vac 2 Pro&#39;s 5,200mAh battery can power the device for up to 220 minutes, which is over 3 hours. In addition, this is an extremely implausible assertion. </p><p><br/></p><p>Sure, the robot cleaner will end the session quickly if users vacuum at the lowest possible suction level. Also, the map of the spaces is already well done &#40;with no new impediments&#41;, but it won&#39;t go above two hours. In the course of my experiments, it lasted a little over an hour half with the suction level set at 1.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671438070434.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that even in idle mode, the robot vacuum continues to do some tasks that need a lot of power. For example, when I unplugged the base from an outlet at 10:00 p.m., the vacuum cleaner robot began looking desperately for the charging dock 14 hours later &#40;when the battery level was at 10%&#41;.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 pro: price</h2><p><br/></p><p>This device, which you can purchase for a total cost of $314, is among the greatest of its kind. Taking everything into consideration, this product is an amazing cleaner; yet its fussy avoidance technology is a drawback. If your house is already staged to seem like a showroom, you probably won&#39;t have any trouble getting full-room coverage.</p><p><br/></p><p>However, if it appears that you genuinely live in the living areas, like the majority of us do, the vacuum may have difficulty cleaning everywhere that you want it to clean. There is a good chance that future upgrades will provide improvements. Still, if you can&#39;t wait, you might want to look into the Roborock S7, which is yet another map vacuum/mop combination that avoids cleaning carpeting by raising its mop component 5 millimeters above the floor.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671438079199.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Because this manufacturer sources components from a wide variety of suppliers, you ought to be able to obtain the mop component from the original equipment manufacturer &#40;OEM&#41; as well as from other vendors. </p><p><br/></p><p>Additionally, the dock station is manufactured by a separate company. The HEPA filter, the sides brushes, and even the rolling brush that is situated at the bottom of the device are all universal. Therefore, it is safe to assume that acquiring this robot&#39;s replacement will not provide any difficulties for you.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Yeedi vac-2 Pro: User Reviews</h2><p><br/></p><p>User reviews are diverse, but the consensus is that this is a top-tier product. It has strong suction performance and is easy to control in its surroundings. While the robot vacuum occasionally has greater difficulty navigating around chair legs, it is ultimately able to do so as well. The corners were the only issue in terms of vacuuming suction power since the robot vacuum wasn&#39;t able to reach such areas very effectively.</p><p><br/></p><p>Many reviewers have praised the robot vacuum&#39;s mopping capabilities, praising its ability to remove stubborn stains thanks to its vibrating mopping pad effectively. The ground has been thoroughly cleaned off them. Moreover, it may program the robot vacuum to wipe the floor twice, completely eliminating the possibility of any remaining stains.</p><p><br/></p><p>According to the reports we&#39;ve read, the Yeedi robot&#39;s array of sensors allows it to avoid obstacles and distinguish between soft and hard surfaces. This way, the carpets are avoided while the mopping process runs.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Yemeni app is simple to use. It&#39;s simple to make rooms and set the mood. The robot vacuum cleaner may also be fully automated, and due to the cleaning schedules, you can designate very clearly on a daily basis when work has to be done.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Should you buy Yeedi vac-2 pro?</h2><p><br/></p><p>When it comes to robot vacuum cleaners, most people know what they need, and Trifo deems the Emma vital since it has those features. Cleans the home passably well despite some odd quirks; has a sizable dustbin, rather good Navigation plus app control. Even though it has certain drawbacks like no-go areas, no remote control, and a short battery, it&#39;s a great option towards manual vacuums, especially given its price &#40;which is generally reduced&#41;.</p><p><br/></p><p>There is little doubt that the Vac 2 Pro&#39;s features and benefits justify its high asking price. Above-average cleaning performance, obstacle avoidance, and an oscillating mop are all features you won&#39;t find on other robot vacuums in this price range.</p><p><br/></p><p>Its obstacle avoidance mechanism will have its limits, and it often stops working after cleaning up a spot with a mop and stick, but it&#39;s a great budget pick.</p><p><br/></p><h2>How we tested Yeedi vac-2 pro?</h2><p><br/></p><p>We put this vacuum through its paces by putting it through a series of tests on a variety of surfaces, including carpets, uneven surfaces, and hard surfaces such as floors. We feel it is necessary to note that it delivered a performance that was commensurate with its cost.</p><p><br/></p><p>Due to its high level of performance and construction quality, it will require some maintenance in order to continue functioning for a more extended length of time. The map on this robot works the best, and cleaning is up to expectations.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"422","score":"4","amazon_adv":[{"id":422,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525686865.jpeg","title":"Yeedi vac 2 pro","original_price":"$649.98","actual_price":"$449.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3EQQoCW","description":""}]}]}
