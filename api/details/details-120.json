And it does it by ditching Lidar in favour of VSLAM technology and employing an oscillating mopping mechanism in an effort to outdo the competition.</p><p><br></p><p>Though I applaud the diffusion of cutting-edge innovations into more reasonably priced robot vacuum cleaners, I must caution that novelty does not necessarily guarantee superiority. There is a distinction between change and improvement, and I know that many manufacturers confuse the two. While I agree that VSLAM holds much promise, having witnessed it in action on a different \"cheap\" robot vacuum cleaner has convinced me to sing the praises of Lidar technology even more loudly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Vac 2 Pro is equipped with a brand-new oscillating mopping mechanism that effectively washes your floors and a smart carpet-detecting feature that keeps it from soaking rugs. What's more, the vacuum can now avoid shoes, pet food bowls, and other potential snares with the help of a 3D collision avoidance capability made possible by newly installed sensors.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671782479244.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Like earlier Yeedi robotic vacuums, this product features a top-mounted camera that can map the space and find its way around. This lets you personalise tasks and make them more effective by letting you choose the order in which they're cleaned. The Vac 2 Pro is similar to the Vac Station in that you can vacuum or mop at the same time; the dustbin is concealed behind the vacuum's lid, and the water tank is concealed within the unit's back. The Vac 2 Pro has 3000pa of suction, much like the Vac Station.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Yeedi vac-2 pro: Key Specs","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":881,"content":"<p>Since the original Roomba made its rounds, the robotic vacuum cleaner hasn't changed its appearance in almost a decade. Considering the circular chassis's usefulness for dodging obstacles of product, it's easy to see why the designers didn't see any reason to alter it. Like the Roborock, the Vac 2 has a white matte surface over a circular plastic container. When I discovered that I could lift the cover at the top to see the Power switch and the trash bin, I was concerned that I had indeed purchased a knockoff.</p><p><br></p><p>After observing the camera that faces upwards on the top of the robotic vacuum cleaner and the underside of the device, it appears to be a more distinctive piece of equipment.\" </p><p><br></p><p>To my knowledge, we are dealing with a device that attempts to create a 360-degree map of its surroundings using a fish-eye lens. It's a novel concept, but it won't be capable of avoiding obstacles like wires or socks as the Trifo Lucy did. But I noticed that I could remove the back half of the Vac 2 Pro, and I know that it has IR sensors all around the casing to help it avoid collisions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671782523316.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>As far as I can see, its only use is to retain the module of the oscillating mopping system and act as a decorative accent. The underside of Vac 2 Pro features wheels that you can adjust in height, a removable roller brush which you can clean thoroughly, and cliff sensors located close to the edge of the box. Moreover, I found a connection between the single corner brush and a carpet-detecting sensor next to the rotating base.

This test aims to determine whether or not it is possible to let the vacuum roam the home while you are asleep. </p><p><br></p><p>The Quiet Mode will generate noise that is somewhere around the average of 45 decibels, which is acceptable so long as the robotic vacuum cleaner does not clean the bedrooms but only the rest of the home. The following suction level, level 2, increases to a mean of 43 dB, which is noisier but still tolerable during the day. The following suction level, level 3, can grow slightly louder, peaking at 53 dB, but it is still tolerable during the day.</p><p><br></p><p>As I discussed in the section on the Mobile Application, it is possible to mark some areas of the map as \"No-Go\" zones, meaning that the vacuum cleaner robot will not enter certain areas.</p><p><br></p><p>And the fact that it is done via the app is a relief to me because I wouldn't say I like the magnet bands that have to be placed within the rooms to use non-Lidar devices, so it's nice, not required. In terms of Area cleaning, you have the option of selecting a certain room to be cleaned or subdividing the larger space into several smaller areas; however, you do not have the capability to manoeuvre the robotic vacuum around manually.

However, it is still one of the most adaptable machines of its kind since it is not \"afraid\" to approach close to an item. Because of this, the product I tested never required any assistance from a human throughout all of my trials.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as the Vac 2 Pro's battery hits 10%, it will begin searching for the docking station, and as you may have read in part titled Navigation, the feature that detects objects will be disabled at this time.
