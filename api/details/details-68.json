Borrowers with short credit histories or poor credit scores may qualify for an FHA loan with something like a minor down payment, if any, as 3.5%. Veterans of the United States Armed Forces are not required to make a down payment on their mortgage. Flagstar requires borrowers to have a credit score of 620 or above for their conventional, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), USDA, and Veterans Administration loans.
