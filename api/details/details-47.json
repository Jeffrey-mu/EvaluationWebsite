The cloud storage options available with the EZVIZ DB1C Video Doorbell are all quite inexpensive, making this product a good buy. In addition, the video quality is excellent, and it comes with several helpful extras that help it stand out in the increasingly crowded market for video doorbells. It’s not as adaptable as other battery-operated doorbells, though.
