Unfortunately, the 2022 refresh of the HP Elite Dragonfly G3 also belongs there. There are several positive aspects to the new Dragonfly. It has a fascinating 3:2 form factor as an alternative to the standard 16:9 widescreen and is constructed with care.</p><p>It has a 12th-generation Intel processor, a huge battery for its class, and better connectivity than one might anticipate from a device with such a minimal form factor. However, it has several serious flaws that detract from the experience. The clarity of the display stands out the most. We'll get into the specifics shortly, but know that you can swap this LCD screen for a more advanced OLED panel if you want. However, the screen quality of the tested HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is inadequate.</p><p>Around its core, the keyboard and base, the aluminum chassis remains robust and sturdy. On the other hand, the lid is just as flimsy as that of the LG gram me or the Samsung Galaxy Book and can be twisted and bent with little effort. Compared to a Specter, the outer lid of this container easily warps when pressure is applied along its central axis. The Dragonfly G3's lid is less sturdy because it is lightweight and prevents Gorilla Glass from reinforcing.</p><p>In contrast to the earlier 2020 launch model, this Dragonfly G3 doesn't quite come in any flashy color variations. The modern color palette is less vibrant and more clinical. The \"Dragonfly\" line is starting to look too much like the standard \"EliteBook\" model in terms of color scheme.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"348","score":"4.5","subtitle":"Best laptops","amazon_adv":[{"id":348,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671507693535.jpeg","title":"HP","original_price":"$2,293.01","actual_price":"$2,293.01","specifications":" Elite Dragonfly","link":"https://amzn.to/3Sr0EWa","description":""}]},{"id":415,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>2.

Compared to its larger siblings, the Razer Blade 15 and 17 (all of which are also excellent choices), this one is the family's baby. This model succeeds the Razer Blade 14 in 2021 and features an AMD Ryzen 5900 HX processor and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, 3070, or RTX 2080 graphics processing unit. The 2022 model keeps the same display options and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU option as its predecessor. However, Razer swapped out the RTX 3070 and 3080 for the RTX 3070 Ti and RTX 3080 Ti and upgraded the CPU to an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX with DDR5 memory. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 is a direct competitor to the Razer Blade 14. (2022).</p><p>Our Razer Blade 14 is an AMD Ryen 9 6900HX, the graphics processor is a discrete NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, there are 16 gigabytes of RAM, and there is a terabyte of storage space. There are just three pre-set options available from Razer. The entry-level model has a 1080p 144Hz display and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. The other variants have a 1440p 165Hz display and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti graphics card. The three variants' processing power, memory, and storage capacities are identical. The total graphics power (TGP) for all three GPUs is 100W.</p><p>As a media center laptop, the Razer Blade 14 holds its own. Its small form factor and long-lasting battery mean that you can easily bring it to the theater or take it with you on a road trip. The screen is vivid and clear, but the low contrast ratio makes blacks look muddy in low light. The speakers can go rather loud, but the sound quality is lacking, particularly in the low and mid frequencies.</p><p><br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"351","score":"4.5","subtitle":"null","amazon_adv":[{"id":351,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671507960977.jpeg","title":"Razer ","original_price":"$2,799.99","actual_price":"$2,399.00","specifications":"Blade 14","link":"https://amzn.to/3xZOgUT","description":""}]},{"id":417,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>4.

That's still available, albeit the keyboard deck has seen some wild changes this year. It's growing on me, I think. For some reason, when I use this XPS 13 Plus, I keep picturing myself using a MacBook. There are not many input/output (IO) ports on it.</p><p>Additionally, the keyboard deck meets the palm rest at a uniform height. Additionally, the trackpad functionality is built right into the palm rest, making it fully smooth. Although I had my doubts, this turned out to be effective.</p><p>Furthermore, there is the uppermost set of keys. Hotkeys and Function keys are now capacitive buttons built into the deck. It's true that they look great and perform adequately, but there is a caveat. This laptop has a wide range of setup options, which is great for someone as picky as me. Also, more robust features than any of the previous XPS 13 versions or the standard XPS 13 of the 2022 generation. The XPS 13 Plus fully utilizes its thin-bezel design by providing a keyboard that extends over the entire device's width.
