It comprises the primary vacuum unit, which features a trigger for operating the cleaner, and the wand and attachments, which clip into the primary unit. Given the pricing, one should not be surprised that the primary body has a rather shoddy and plasticky feel.</p><p><br></p><p>You can push a button, but it doesn't work like a standard trigger. To operate the vacuum, you only need to squeeze this once to turn it on and then squeeze it again to turn it off. You wonâ€™t hold it in yourself for sure. When you switch the vacuum on for the first time, it goes into Auto mode. This causes it to monitor the suction pressure automatically, increasing it for carpets and decreasing it for hard surfaces as appropriate. It is made to lengthen the time a battery may last.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671782944481.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>By pressing the button on that LCD located on the device's back, you may take control of the vacuum and set it to either its minimal or maximum setting. There is a brief pause between pulling the trigger and thus the vacuum turning on, and there is a brief pause between tilting the vacuum back and the floor head's motorized brush starting to move. Both of these events are preceded by a little pause.</p><p><br></p><p>You may secure the mopping device to the rear of the floor unit using a magnet if you so want. After you have refilled the little water tank, water will soak through the system to moisten the microfiber cloth used for cleaning.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Proscenic P11 vacuum: Key Specs","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":890,"content":"<p>The design of Proscenic does not make any attempt to be innovative. The P11 picks up just where the Dyson left off. It's a cordless, bagless vacuum cleaner in the standard size and form. The dustbin is see-through.</p><p><br></p><p>Because it is a classic stick vacuum, the P11 does not have a feature that allows it to stand independently. If you stop to take a break while you're cleaning, you'll have to put it down on the ground or push it into a side. Nonetheless, while being used, it is light and simple to navigate around. It comes with a Hepa filter that can clean and a trashcan that can be removed and cleaned easily while being just 0.65 litres in capacity.</p><p><br></p><p>You can't deny that Proscenic put some effort into the extras. When you open the P11 box, you'll see that the vacuum and all accessories are neatly packed in cardboard scabbards. The elements of the vacuum cleaner are designed to click effortlessly into place, making the assembly process quite short.</p><p><br></p><p>The cleaner wand is made of metal, which lends it a luxury sense; however, this is somewhat mitigated by the inclusion of Proscenic's sugary tagline, which reads \"Endless Love For Family.\" This is odd, considering that these are the least suitable vacuums for use in homes with children.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671782978215.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The P11 comes with four primary attachments, including a motorized cleaner head, brush, crevice tool, and a circular brush that can swivel to 90 degrees for simple surface cleaning when used in handy mode. It can be used either as a stick cleaning or a handheld cleaner. The most recent attachment, the most useful one, was added to the set.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Proscenic P11 vacuum: Design","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":891,"content":"<p>The P11 is designed to clean up any mess you can throw. It utilizes a brushless motor system with 450 watts of power and can produce up to 25k Pa of suction when set to its highest settings. As previously indicated, you may switch between Economy, Auto, and Peak power settings. In the latter mode, the P11's suction strength adapts automatically to the floor type it's cleaning.</p><p><br></p><p>The vacuum easily swept up and threw away the cereal, even on the lowest power level. Does this mean that the vacuum emerges victorious when the rubber meets the road? To a large extent, it is correct.</p><p><br></p><p>We put the vacuums through their paces by cleaning the floors of a 1,300-square-foot apartment with carpets, linoleum, or tile. We started our time with the P11's Eco mode and a fully charged battery. Our luxurious carpeting was covered in filth, debris, and hair when we finished using the vacuum, and we were shocked at how much it picked up.</p><p><br></p><p>We subsequently decided to turn up the volume by shifting to full blast. Even though the P11's operating volume increases with the increased suction power, we found that the battery suffered significant wear and tore under these conditions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671783029312.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Contrarily, when set to Eco mode, we managed to vacuum about two-thirds of the flat without recharge. We barely made it through one area on Max power before the battery died; another room drained the P11 to a third of all its original charge. However, this result shouldn't come as a surprise, given that many cordless vacuums experience a loss of suction power when the power setting is turned up to its maximum.</p><p><br></p><p>In Automatic mode, the P11 adapts its suction strength to the surface it is cleaning. When I place the brush head on our kitchenette linoleum, automatic mode sounds almost as loud as the Max setting but much more muted than Eco mode.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Proscenic P11 vacuum: Performance","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":892,"content":"<p>The lithium-ion battery pack within the Proscenic P11 has a 2,500mAh capacity and can power the device for up to an hour. The manufacturer asserts that its rapid charge technology can fully recharge the battery in under three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>We found that the claimed one-hour duration was unrealistic. Since automatic and max performance settings significantly reduce battery life, we speculate that they achieved this spec by using the P11 solely in Eco mode. In practice, we got nearly 35 minutes of use out of it before the battery needed to be recharged, and that was using a mix of all three suction speeds.</p><p><br></p><p>It would seem sensible to turn up the power to \"get things clean,\" but vacuuming pro-Tom Wiltshire showed me why I was better off using the automatic setting. More micro dust and pattern restoration will result from a vacuuming process in which the brush is not obstructed by being dragged into the carpeting piles by too much vacuum.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671783059817.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, plenty of runtimes allow the vacuum to go quickly across a few rooms on many occasions and remove all the fine dust from the floor.
