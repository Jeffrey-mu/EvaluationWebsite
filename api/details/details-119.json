This appearance is accentuated by a lighted panel that displays the charge level and vacuum strength and cautions that you should back off whenever the load becomes excessive. </p><p><br></p><p>It is a good function to have on equipment that typically does not give you any feedback or control. Yet, most of the time, you will keep it in the automatic mode, switching to the maximum setting for things like cobwebs.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a wall-mounted hook that the battery falls into, a little charger with a pretty short line, making it rather difficult to find locations for the hanger to reside in old buildings with fewer plugs, and a small trashcan. These components are typical of cleaners that belong to this category.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: Key Specs</h2><p><br></p><p><b>Price: </b>$229</p><p><b>Type: </b>stick vacuum (cordless)</p><p><b>Size: </b>1255.255.221</p><p><b>Weight: </b>2.8kg</p><p><b>Tools: </b>floor head, mini and crevice tool, brush</p><p><b>Bin Capacity: </b>0.65l</p><p><br></p><p>This is a classic example of a cordless stick vacuum cleaner in the form of the P11 Vacuum Cleaner. It comprises the primary vacuum unit, which features a trigger for operating the cleaner, and the wand and attachments, which clip into the primary unit. Given the pricing, one should not be surprised that the primary body has a rather shoddy and plasticky feel.</p><p><br></p><p>You can push a button, but it doesn't work like a standard trigger. To operate the vacuum, you only need to squeeze this once to turn it on and then squeeze it again to turn it off. You won’t hold it in yourself for sure. When you switch the vacuum on for the first time, it goes into Auto mode. This causes it to monitor the suction pressure automatically, increasing it for carpets and decreasing it for hard surfaces as appropriate. It is made to lengthen the time a battery may last.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437882152.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>By pressing the button on that LCD located on the device's back, you may take control of the vacuum and set it to either its minimal or maximum setting. There is a brief pause between pulling the trigger and thus the vacuum turning on, and there is a brief pause between tilting the vacuum back and the floor head's motorized brush starting to move. Both of these events are preceded by a little pause.</p><p><br></p><p>You may secure the mopping device to the rear of the floor unit using a magnet if you so want. After you have refilled the little water tank, water will soak through the system to moisten the microfiber cloth used for cleaning.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: Design</h2><p><br></p><p>The design of Proscenic does not make any attempt to be innovative. The P11 picks up just where the Dyson left off. It's a cordless, bagless vacuum cleaner in the standard size and form. The dustbin is see-through.</p><p><br></p><p>Because it is a classic stick vacuum, the P11 does not have a feature that allows it to stand independently. If you stop to take a break while you're cleaning, you'll have to put it down on the ground or push it into a side. Nonetheless, while being used, it is light and simple to navigate around. It comes with a Hepa filter that can clean and a trashcan that can be removed and cleaned easily while being just 0.65 litres in capacity.</p><p><br></p><p>You can't deny that Proscenic put some effort into the extras. When you open the P11 box, you'll see that the vacuum and all accessories are neatly packed in cardboard scabbards. The elements of the vacuum cleaner are designed to click effortlessly into place, making the assembly process quite short.</p><p><br></p><p>The cleaner wand is made of metal, which lends it a luxury sense; however, this is somewhat mitigated by the inclusion of Proscenic's sugary tagline, which reads \"Endless Love For Family.\" This is odd, considering that these are the least suitable vacuums for use in homes with children.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437893754.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The P11 comes with four primary attachments, including a motorized cleaner head, brush, crevice tool, and a circular brush that can swivel to 90 degrees for simple surface cleaning when used in handy mode. It can be used either as a stick cleaning or a handheld cleaner. The most recent attachment, the most useful one, was added to the set.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: Performance</h2><p><br></p><p> The P11 is designed to clean up any mess you can throw. It utilizes a brushless motor system with 450 watts of power and can produce up to 25k Pa of suction when set to its highest settings. As previously indicated, you may switch between Economy, Auto, and Peak power settings. In the latter mode, the P11's suction strength adapts automatically to the floor type it's cleaning.</p><p><br></p><p>The vacuum easily swept up and threw away the cereal, even on the lowest power level. Does this mean that the vacuum emerges victorious when the rubber meets the road? To a large extent, it is correct.</p><p><br></p><p>We put the vacuums through their paces by cleaning the floors of a 1,300-square-foot apartment with carpets, linoleum, or tile. We started our time with the P11's Eco mode and a fully charged battery. Our luxurious carpeting was covered in filth, debris, and hair when we finished using the vacuum, and we were shocked at how much it picked up.</p><p><br></p><p>We subsequently decided to turn up the volume by shifting to full blast. Even though the P11's operating volume increases with the increased suction power, we found that the battery suffered significant wear and tore under these conditions.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437907435.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Contrarily, when set to Eco mode, we managed to vacuum about two-thirds of the flat without recharge. We barely made it through one area on Max power before the battery died; another room drained the P11 to a third of all its original charge. However, this result shouldn't come as a surprise, given that many cordless vacuums experience a loss of suction power when the power setting is turned up to its maximum.</p><p><br></p><p>In Automatic mode, the P11 adapts its suction strength to the surface it is cleaning. When I place the brush head on our kitchenette linoleum, automatic mode sounds almost as loud as the Max setting but much more muted than Eco mode.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: Battery Life</h2><p><br></p><p>The lithium-ion battery pack within the Proscenic P11 has a 2,500mAh capacity and can power the device for up to an hour. The manufacturer asserts that its rapid charge technology can fully recharge the battery in under three hours.</p><p><br></p><p>We found that the claimed one-hour duration was unrealistic. Since automatic and max performance settings significantly reduce battery life, we speculate that they achieved this spec by using the P11 solely in Eco mode. In practice, we got nearly 35 minutes of use out of it before the battery needed to be recharged, and that was using a mix of all three suction speeds.</p><p><br></p><p>It would seem sensible to turn up the power to \"get things clean,\" but vacuuming pro-Tom Wiltshire showed me why I was better off using the automatic setting. More micro dust and pattern restoration will result from a vacuuming process in which the brush is not obstructed by being dragged into the carpeting piles by too much vacuum.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437919454.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, plenty of runtimes allow the vacuum to go quickly across a few rooms on many occasions and remove all the fine dust from the floor. Tiny pet fur and dust particles on hard surfaces may be cleaned effectively in green mode, while the Max mode is optimal for cleaning car interiors with crevice and brush tools. Proscenic recommends that its clients buy an extra battery in case of battery failure.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: price</h2><p><br></p><p>The P11 Intelligent Cordless Vacuum is available for purchase on Amazon and directly from Proscenic for $239. This is a discount from the product's original MSRP of $259. In addition, the P11 comes with a limited warranty that lasts for one year.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to the capacitive touchscreen and the charging station, the P11 includes a further premium feature. If you were wondering, it would be a set of incredibly powerful LED headlights. Even while lights on such a cleaner are not required in any way, they make it much easier to see what you're doing when cleaning dark nooks, crannies, and below furniture.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437939649.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Nevertheless, in spite of all of these advantages, I can't help but feel that the overall quality of its build isn't quite up to par. During the evaluation, the battery became somewhat dislodged from its housing, and I'm left with the impression that this is not going to be a product that will serve you well for many years to come.</p><p><br></p><h2>Proscenic P11 vacuum: User Reviews</h2><p><br></p><p>On Amazon, the P11 has earned an excellent 4.4 rating out of a possible 5, and more than 70 percent of customers have rated it with the maximum possible score of five stars. The lengthy battery life, its automatic mode, and the Led bulbs, which make it simpler to start picking up debris and dirt in dark corners, have all been praised positively by satisfied customers.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor suction power and incorrect battery charging are cited as difficulties plaguing particular appliances in reviews that are critical of the product</p><p><br></p><p>Quite a few individuals have mentioned how difficult it is to clear and cleanse the dust cup. Another user echoes this sentiment, stating that there is no way to \"dump\" it when there is pet hair present. To remove all of the hair, I need to take it fully apart and disassemble it.</p><p><br></p><h2>Should you buy Proscenic P11 vacuum?</h2><p><br></p><p>It does not have an authoritative tone. It does not threaten to inhale young children or pets and does not cause the carpet to pull off the tacks. The Proscenic P11, on the other hand, is able to pick up dust and grime that my mains-powered upright vacuum leaves behind. It also performs a fantastic job of cleaning the interior of vehicles, in part because of its compact size and low weight.</p><p><br></p><p>To go more specific, the P11 has proven to be a game-changer for people who have a lot going on in their lives and are easily distracted by a variety of things. Because it is simple to take the vacuum, run it around the corners and carpets, and swiftly empty the contents of the vacuum into the bin, the house is extremely clean. There is no postponing cleaning up messes or leaving them \"to be vacuumed later.\" This would not be the case if it did not have the power to perform a good job, was too heavy, and, most importantly, if it did not cost only a little bit more than an excellent corded upright vacuum cleaner.</p><p><br></p><p>The P11 is an amazing product in terms of its entire design and in terms of its ability to demonstrate that a sufficiently low portable vacuum can be a truly useful item for both the house and the vehicle. I highly suggest it, especially if the thought of switching in and dragging a cumbersome upright vacuum cleaner every evening or on the weekend causes you to feel anxious.</p><p><br></p><h2>How we tested the P11 cordless vacuum?</h2><p><br></p><p>We have tested this vacuum through different tests, such as on carpets, rough surfaces, and hard surfaces like floors. We have to say that it performed all right for its price point. With the average performance and build quality, it will take some maintenance to work for longer. We hope this review helps you with your decision. </p>","amazon_adv_id":"421","score":"4","amazon_adv":[{"id":421,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525644991.jpeg","title":"Proscenic P11 cordless vacuum cleaner","original_price":"$259.99","actual_price":"$179.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3EPONNq","description":""}]}]}
