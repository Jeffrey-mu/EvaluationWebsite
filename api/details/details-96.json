Your voice is audible, crisp, and reminiscent of a landline telephone. It can withstand light wind (albeit not strong, like any other earphone), and your speech will be transmitted even if there is ambient noise, such as people talking or passing vehicles. Interference is minimally triggered by brief bursts of noise, such as those produced by a scooter's acceleration. Noise from the wind and other sources might add to the difficulty. The fact that you may need to amplify your voice to be heard is a further drawback. The clarity of the calls is excellent. Your volume is enough, and your voice is distinct and unforced. And the ambient noise isn't as loud, so it doesn't drown out your speech. Importing them into your next Google Meet or Zoom session takes a few clicks.</p><p><br></p><p>The Air3 Pro's Game Mode makes it a great choice for iPhone gaming; there is a minimal lag between the sounds and, indeed, the action on your screen, and the Air3 Pro even amplifies some bass to immerse you in the game further. However, it isn't the most accurate in narrowing down where the action is around you, as was demonstrated in Call of Duty mobile. While Android's latency is higher, the platform's performance and accessibility make it a delight to play games on. On Android and the iPhone, video, and audio playback in perfect time, making video streaming a breeze.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Connections, Entertainment, And Games","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":948,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432359757.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>Unfortunately, SoundPEATS Air 3 Pro app support for iOS and Android is currently unavailable. The Android app is trying to upgrade the earbuds' firmware, but it cannot do so, and the iPhone app does not support this model (yet). When there are updates, they will be posted here.

Regarding the quality of ANC: Astoundingly, the SoundPEATS Air3 Pro's active noise canceling features may be rather potent. Just plug in your headphones to immediately begin blocking out ambient noise; ANC is on by default. Sound from the radio or people talking close may still be heard, although they are much quieter. Background noise, such as traffic, is drastically decreased, but static noises, such as electrical humming, and close sounds, such as keyboard clicking, are filtered highly effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Some ambient sound will likely remain, but you may also become acutely aware of your respiration. The Air3 Pro ANC seems less effective when plenty of louder noises surround you, such as children laughing or traffic. The presence of white noise helps to mask the surrounding noises. But without any music being played, this cannot be accomplished. When you press play, your immediate environment will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The quality of the Transparency (also known as Passthrough) option is quite similar to that of the ANC off-setting. Turning off Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) allows you to hear and find nearby traffic at a moderate level and eliminates the wind noise that comes with Transparency settings. However, neighboring conversations may be heard using the Transparency option, even at a modest level. Reduce the sound of the wind: Although the Air 3 Pro's ANC and Transparency modes reduce wind noise, a noticeable amount of background noise remains. Thankfully, ANC can be disabled remotely, right from your earphones.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"3rd Prototype Air Noise Cancellation Test using ANC","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":950,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432378309.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The sound quality on the SoundPEATS Air 3 Pro is enjoyable, although it might need some fine-tuning. The Air3 Pro has a refined sound quality. The lower frequency range is mostly to blame for this. Like the SoundPEATS Mini Pro, the bass and midrange are subtly amplified to give deeper electronic tones and drums more of a presence. The bass on these two earphones is somewhat different. The bass on the Air3 Pro is more compact, but that's not all there is to it. Modern genres, including dance, pop, and hip-hop, get adequate strength from the mid-bass punch, but the bass tones drag on a little and aren't the fastest.</p><p><br></p><p>The sub-bass (the lowest tones you can physically feel) is excellent. James Blake's demo track Limit to Your Love is a good example of how it can rumble gleefully and deeply while not being hesitant to display its completeness and depth in denser arrangements. However, things might get a little chaotic in the bottom end when many bass lines are combined. The treble region is considerably rougher than the rest. Songs emphasizing the upper mids may sound a bit unsteady, while female, particularly higher-pitched male voices, are somewhat upfront and crisp. The vocals might sound slightly nasal, and the higher instruments like violins and percussion can come off as thin.</p><p><br></p><p>The Air3 Pro is more comprehensive than the Mini Pro in terms of features. While there is a slight graininess from around snare drum frequency, typical of many budget earbuds, the vocals are the focus of the song and are frequently brought to the forefront of the mix. The Mini Pro is more open in the upper frequencies and may flank you more from your left and right, while the Air3 Pro puts more of a warm blanket over you but still allows for adequate separation between instruments. SoundPEATS Air3 Pro provides a fun listening experience overall. However, it distorts a little in songs that emphasize the bass or treble.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Quality Of Sound In Soundpeats Air 3 Pro","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":951,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432387184.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>Does it make sense that the Air3 Pro and, indeed, the half-in-ear, original Air3 have the same name, except for the earbuds' design and the lovely tiny charging case? Is there a lot of similarity between the two? Actually, sure. Both are bass-heavy and midrange-forward without going overboard, so the treble doesn't become too piercing. The Air3 Pro offers smoother voices and more robust bass. More space and upper-midrange thickness may be found in the standard Air3.</p><p><br></p><p>The Air3 Pro adds to the capabilities of the Air3. The newer Pro, of course, comes with ANC, has around 5 hours of battery power (ANC on) as opposed to 4,5, makes your voice audible and clear in video conversations and includes a gaming mode that is more in tune with the action somewhat on screen. But the SoundPEATS Air3 is a fantastic budget-friendly alternative to the <b>AirPods 3</b>, and the SoundPEATS Air3 Pro is a great budget-friendly alternative to the AirPods Pro.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Comparisons: Soundpeats Air 3 Pro Vs.
