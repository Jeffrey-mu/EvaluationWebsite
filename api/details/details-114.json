Additionally, your entire body will be worked on and strengthened.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Total Gym FIT seems to be an excellent option for a home gym because it is sturdy, compact, and can move with relative ease. Read on to find out if the Total Gym FIT is the right home gym equipment for you.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: Key Specs</h2><p><br/></p><p><b>Price:</b> $1,699.95</p><p><b>Shape:</b> Glideboard-design</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 66-pound</p><p><b>Limit:</b> 400 lbs.</p><p><b>Dimensions:</b> 18.5 x 93 x 44.5; &#40;unfolded&#41; and18.5 x 50.5 x 8.5 &#40;folded&#41;</p><p><b>Warranty:</b> 2 years</p><p><br/></p><p>This product allows you to exercise with constant resistance only by using your body weight, and there are a wide variety of ways to do this. This means you may get a full-body workout utilizing just one glideboard by switching between 85 distinct bodyweight workouts.</p><p><br/></p><p>This home exercise equipment is an excellent choice for those who worry about not having enough room.</p><p>The Gym FIT is one of the costly options for home gym equipment, although being somewhat more compact than the original. Despite this, it has several advantages that make it a complete home fitness equipment, such as cross-fit and body strength exercises. Adding a pilates package allows for even more muscle lengthening and toning and the development of a rock-solid midsection.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671435424812.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Four total-body home gyms are displayed on the Total Gym website, and they&#39;re all very similar in appearance. Every Total Gym contains a Glideboard, a cushioned training bench encircled by pulleys, and several other workout types of equipment. A quick comparison of Total Gym sets reveals significant variation in the Glideboard and included accessories.</p><p>The glideboard parameters are the primary differentiating factor between the machines. To modify the difficulty level, alter the incline of the cushioned training board. You can either reduce the effects of gravity or exert yourself against a more significant proportion of your own body weight. You may tailor your strength exercises to your needs by selecting one of the 12 options.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: Design</h2><p>The pulley &&#39; cabling system utilized by the foldable Total Gym FIT is constructed all around the glideboard. Resistance establishes so that you can work against it so that you can improve your strength when you move your arms, legs, and otherwise slide about it. Because you can change the resistance level on the board, you may make the workouts more challenging or more accessible to suit your needs as you advance in your fitness. The total weight of the apparatus is around 66 pounds.</p><p><br/></p><p>As noted before in our review of the Total Gym FIT, the essential aspect of this system is the accessories. These attachments allow you to utilize the machine in various ways, allowing you to exercise different portions of your body. You will get a leg pulley, an updated squat stand, an abdominal crunch attachment, and two other wing inserts as part of the standard package. You may monitor your workout by wearing a few of the finest fitness trackers, which would allow you to observe how strenuously you are exercising.</p><p><br/></p><p>A dietary guidebook, a board chat for documenting progress, a library of training Videos to assist you in implementing easy guidance and staying inspired, and two ankle cuffs are also in the package as additional extras. The cuffs are there to provide comfort.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671435439940.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>At first glance, this product could appear to be an uncomplicated system; nevertheless, it comes with a surprising number of functions that are there to assist you in transforming your body. mIn a word, this weights system can build and develop every significant muscle part in your body, and it can do so by allowing you to perform a wide variety of exercises, such as squats, abdomen crunches, leg presses, and many more. The price point for this system falls in the middle.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: Performance</h2><p>The Glideboard that comes with the Total Gym FIT is without a doubt the one that looks the greatest, but the exercise accessories are by far the more crucial aspect:</p><p><br/></p><p>The AbCrunch Accessory from Total Gym is their top-selling product in the category of accessories. It&#39;s helpful for basic and advanced variations of abdominal crunches, all of which work to strengthen the core, extend the obliques, and improve your posture.</p><p>Two-Piece Wing Attachment Instead of using the Total Gym&#39;s standard wing accessory, you may now use the more advanced two-piece wing attachment to strengthen your arms and abdominal muscles.</p><p>The leg-pull attachments with the Total Gym help strengthen your quadriceps and hamstrings.</p><p>The squat stand included in the FIT gym is an enhanced version of those seen in less expensive models. Using this exercise equipment, which has a height that can adjust, you can get your legs in shape and tone them.</p><p>When you get sick of all of those accessories, you may purchase new additions to add to the existing Total Gym training program, including the pilates set. These accessories are available for sale.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671435448605.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>- A brand-new system for automatically locking the height adjustment makes switching between exercises much simpler.</p><p>- Elastic nylon rope handles</p><p>- Forged Slide Hinge Component for increased tensile strength and wear resistance</p><p>- The brand-new Customized Fender Model resulted in a more comfortable ride.</p><p>- Improvements made to the Pulley and Cable system, as well as the Steel Frame</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: Comfort and Usability</h2><p>Total Gym is so self-assured in the quality of its construction that in addition to the industry-standard lifetime warranty on the frame, they also provide an extensive two-year warranty on each and every component of the product.</p><p><br/></p><p>If there is an issue, it is most likely a problem with the bearings or the bushings. Because they are insured, there is no need for concern throughout the adjustment period or in the years that follow it.</p><p><br/></p><p>Each of the other inclines on the Total Gym has the same thick vinyl and firm cushioning measuring two inches in height as this one. When you perform abdominal crunches while kneeling on the board, the rigid foam will be kind to your knees and provide a comfortable surface. When you lie back, it also does a beautiful job cushioning those pressure points between your hips and shoulders, which can be uncomfortable.</p><p><br/></p><p>Along the lines of some of the other exercise machines in this category, you have a total of 12 different levels of resistance. If you prefer to micromanage your resistance, be sure to consider it. There are a few additional Total Gym incline machines, but they only have six levels.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671435496758.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The FIT has made a significant advancement, which the other institutions have not yet accomplished. Instead of requiring you to manually hold the panel in place while you lock it with the locking bar, which keeps the panel in position for the different inclines, the securing bar snaps into position automatically. It is not difficult to use. When choosing the various models, you should keep this update in mind because it is almost certain that the others will adopt it in the near future.</p><p><br/></p><p>The training deck is one of my favorites. Because it is a stack of playing cards, it is commonly referring to as a deck. Every card features a different workout. You may keep the card handy and easily accessible by attaching the holder to the machine&#39;s top. That is an excellent starting point for novices.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: price</h2><p>The current price ranges from approximately $1500 to $1600, which is a significant amount of money; however, the product&#39;s quality can justify the higher cost.</p><p>This product is an excellent piece of equipment for your home gym because it possesses several essential characteristics. It is simple to assemble and take down for storage. In addition to this, it is pretty easy to use and provides a great deal of leeway for customization. </p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671435516164.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Because of the wide range of attachments and exercise alternatives, you won&#39;t have time to become bored. You won&#39;t have to worry about hurting yourself thanks to the adjustable levels of resistance depending on your body weight. In general, the Gym FIT seems to be reliable exercise equipment that can assist you in achieving your weight loss and toning goals.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Total Gym Fit: User Reviews</h2><p><br/></p><p>The FIT is one of the most well-known and widely used incline machines in the Total Gym. At the very least, that&#39;s the way I thought from the dozens of customer testimonials I read online.</p><p><br/></p><p>A few others wished for a wider board. Some individuals grumbled about the additional cost of approximately $200 for the broader squat stand and the wing grip. Several users appreciated how sturdy it felt under their feet when exercising on it. </p><p><br/></p><p>The specific diet Dan Isaacson concocted for Total Gym has proven to be rather popular. Overall, there were very few instances of buyer&#39;s remorse that could document. It would appear that the cost is the primary source of concern.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Should you buy Total Gym Fit?</h2><p><br/></p><p>The Gym FIT is a fantastic alternative if you are looking for a system that can provide a full-body workout but limits room in your home. After each exercise, the equipment is foldable for easy storage as a result of the fact that it makes use of the user&#39;s body weight.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition, this can serve as your long-term fitness companion as it provides you with a wide variety of exercises to choose from, instructional DVDs that can motivate and lead you, and a wealth of online training support. The Total FIT is not inexpensive, but for the price, you receive a lot of value.</p><p>Total Gym is an established name in the fitness world, having been around for several decades. Many consumers consider their Gym FIT the most excellent buy in terms of a home gym. In spite of this, it could be beneficial to spend a few minutes contrasting Total Gyms. On the website of the manufacturer, you can compare the two in a side-by-side format. </p><p><br/></p><p>The machines are pretty comparable to one another, but there is a huge disparity between them in regard to the cost and the attachments. It is possible that you will save money in the long run by purchasing a less expensive model and supplementing it with a few additional add-ons. Because of the ease with which you can customize these machines, you must do your homework before purchasing a Total Gym to ensure that you won&#39;t waste your money on a device that you won&#39;t ever be able to utilize to its total capacity.</p><p><br/></p><h2>How we tested Total Gym Fit?</h2><p><br/></p><p>The FIT comes preassembled, similar to most Total Gym incline machines. Preparing it for any workout is as simple as adjusting the incline and attaching a piece of equipment. It takes no more than a minute to complete.</p><p><br/></p><p>The glide has a texture that is both solid and silky to the touch. In this regard, Total Gym is head and shoulders above the competition. Because each of their slopes is constructed entirely of solid material, the overall operation has a great feel to it, but with a little bit of shake.</p><p><br/></p><p>If you choose the basic FIT version, you will receive the average padded squat stand and the ergonomic tri-grip grips. You will receive the upgraded ribbed squat rack, which is broader and can accommodate more weight, and the more adaptable wing grips. Total Gym deserves praise because the leg pulls attachment with most of their incline machines. Because of the connection point of this accessory, you can perform a series of leg exercises that are both effective and comfortable.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"416","score":"4.5","amazon_adv":[{"id":416,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525408606.jpeg","title":"Total Gym FIT","original_price":"$1,699.99","actual_price":"$1,699.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3T8EaK0","description":""}]}]}
