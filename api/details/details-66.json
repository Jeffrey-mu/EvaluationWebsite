  "description": "When you refinance your mortgage, you stay in your current house but sign a new loan agreement. You don't have to pack up and move; instead, you may close with a new lender who could provide better terms (lower interest rate, longer or shorter loan term, cash back for principal paid) or even a lower interest rate in exchange for your existing mortgage's equity. Similar to the charges associated with purchasing a new house, closing costs for a new loan might amount to two percent six percent of the loan amount. You should only refinance if you intend to remain in your current house for at least a few years after closing to make up the money you spent upon that refinancing.",

Factors such as your credit history and the amount you wish to put down will determine your Rate.

The firm has funded billions of dollars and targets early-stage professionals by offering services, including refinancing school loans, mortgages, unsecured loans, asset management, insurance, bank accounts, and business services. The firm has discontinued its ARM and jumbo mortgage offerings, but it does provide a wide variety of fixed-rate mortgages in the stock market, with four different maturities from which to choose. In addition, compared to other big lenders, its loan acceptance criterion is more lenient.</p><p><br/></p>",

There are a few additional options that Reali Loans provides that may be appealing to prospective homeowners. The business's Buy Before You Sell program might help streamline the process if you want to purchase and sell a house simultaneously. Reali Loans also provides a Cash Offer program through which the firm will make a cash offer on a home you're interested in purchasing and then resell it to you at a fair price.
