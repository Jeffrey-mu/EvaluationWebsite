Credit reports are provided every month by IdentityIQ and MyFICO, two of the leading identity theft prevention services. At the same time, they are provided once a year by LifeLock but also by Identity Guard. AnnualCreditReport.com also offers free credit reports once per year from each agency and weekly reports from each bureau for free till April 2021. Credit reports should be requested at least once every three months, but once a month is preferable.

Lenders utilize FICO credit ratings, which differ somewhat from these when deciding whether or not to provide credit to you. MyFICO, another credit-monitoring service, allows access to FICO credit ratings. Score Tracker on IdentityForce's main Dashboard page displays a graph of individual VantageScore 3.0 credit ratings, so I could see whether or not they had gone up or down over time. Each user's IdentityForce profile will soon have a Breach Clarity risk intelligence score.

It covers the expense of replacing official papers like driver's licenses and passports. Up to $2,000 towards travel costs are covered under the policy.

Changing the levels at which your account is monitored for unusual activity may reduce the number of warnings you get. At a certain point, IdentityForce will stop bothering you. The service will let you know if someone attempts to get a loan or create a bank account in your name.
