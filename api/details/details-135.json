Credit reports are provided every month by IdentityIQ and MyFICO, two of the leading identity theft prevention services. At the same time, they are provided once a year by LifeLock but also by Identity Guard.

Lenders utilize FICO credit ratings, which differ somewhat from these when deciding whether or not to provide credit to you. MyFICO, another credit-monitoring service, allows access to FICO credit ratings. Score Tracker on IdentityForce's main Dashboard page displays a graph of individual VantageScore 3.0 credit ratings, so I could see whether or not they had gone up or down over time.
