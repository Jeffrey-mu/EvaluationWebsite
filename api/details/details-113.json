With a depth amplitude of 11mm and a speed range of 1200-3200 RPM, this Massager is ideal for penetrating muscle tension.</p><p><br></p><p>The G5 Massage Gun comes with seven head attachments, each designed to target a different body part and provide a distinctive kind of massage. Two of them feature a stainless-steel head, making them suitable for use with massage oils and lotions. The brochure with the G5 Massager explains what each of the attachments is best suited for; one is supposedly an anti-cellulite head, but the instructions are sparse.</p><p><br></p><p>If you wish to keep going, all you have to do is turn it back on, but it's a convenient tool to know that you've been continuing for a long time.

Turonic G5 has seven. These targeted heads let you effectively train every muscle in your body. One head is specifically designed for the neck and shoulders, and another is for use on the back, chest, and thighs. A third for use on the hands and feet, Single pair for use with deep oil, and a fourth for use with an anti-cellulite effect.</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to other massage handguns on the market, the Turonic holds its own. The 1200-3200 rpm speed range and 8-hour battery life make for a longer and more vigorous massage. There are five settings to select from to get the desired amount of force. Using this deep tissue massager, you can expect similar benefits to those of a professional massage therapist's hand.

The lengthy battery, however, implies that it can spend considerable time without being recharged. G5 requires approximately three hours of charging time whenever necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>Because it is a little gentler than the others and since it distributes the reverberation out over a broader surface area, the spherical attachment is the mildest of the three options available.

The anti-cellulite head that has applied to my calves ended up being one of my favorites. However, it gives me a slight itch. Because of the tickling sensation, I have avoided applying it to the regions of my body most affected by cellulite. I have it in spades. My son, who is six years old, refers to it as a tickle machine.</p><p><br></p><p>I began by attempting it on the knee that had given me trouble earlier. My knee was starting to feel painful and rigid the day following a lower body exercise that was approved by, nay, insisted upon by, my physiotherapist.

I attempted to use the ball but could only get to the third position.</p><p><br></p><p>The bullet attachment was the one I was most hesitant to use, but it turned out to be the perfect tool for getting to the precise location on the backside of my knee, where most of the pain emanated.
