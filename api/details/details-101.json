A Vero with a Core i7 processor, one terabyte solid-state drive (SSD), and 16 gigabytes of RAM would save you £849–$899. A lot of stuff for less than a grand. That's impressive. While this review does have some complaints, it is encouraging to see Acer bringing together environmental consciousness with the traditional Aspire value for which the brand is known.

The company isn't shy about pointing out how much-recycled content is in the device. There is 30% recycled hardware in the chassis and screen bezel, 99% in the display, and 50% in the keycaps. In the end, Vero's chassis architecture supposedly generates 21% less CO2 than a regular 15.6 laptop, according to Acer. The packaging is equally as eco-friendly as the laptop, with 85% post-consumer recycled paper and 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. As a bonus, you can use the container to prop up your computer. That's fantastic, and it's great for the planet, too. Even if other firms don't advertise their lower numbers, Vero is still not the leader in many of these categories. H.P.'s Elite Dragonfly notebooks and several MacBook Pros employ much more recyclable materials than the Vero, while Apple's latest MacBooks use only recycled aluminum.</p><p><br></p><p>The environmentally friendly features of Acer's computer are boldly advertised. The PCR logo is permanently imprinted on the wrist rest; it is not a detachable sticker. One such measure taken to lessen dependency on dangerous chemicals is the absence of paint. On the other hand, the Vero is gray and patterned with yellow dots that may be cardboard or concrete. This is undoubtedly a conversation starter, but it's not for everyone. The Vero has an HDMI, audio output, and 2 USB 3.2 Generation 1 connections. There's a fingerprint sensor, camera, dual-band wifi 6, wifi 5.0, and Gigabit Ethernet for internal networking. The Vero has a USB-C connector. However, it can't be used to charge the laptop and doesn't have a bank card or Thunderbolt. You can easily swap out or upgrade the parts since they are just held in place by standard screws on the bottom. That's useful, but it's not ordinary for a laptop in the average price range.</p><p><br></p><p>The Samsung Book is a 1.55-kilogram, 15.4-mm-thick, 15.6-inch laptop, while the even lighter Huawei Take this opportunity to introduce D 14 is only 14 inches in screen size. The Samsung laptop also includes a slot for microSD cards and is sleeker overall than the Vero. The Vero is also poorly made. The wrist rest wiggles somewhat, and the base bends slightly. The display may easily be bent, and the plastic above the keyboard is relatively weak. If you're looking for a long-lasting laptop that won't contribute to electronic waste, the Acer probably isn't your best choice.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Design-Build","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":992,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433108285.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The keyboard on the Acer Vero is quick, precise, and quiet enough for daily usage. It has a numeric keypad, an extra-wide space bar, and a taller return key. Good enough for essential internet use, email, and word processing. However, those with higher expectations would be disappointed. The buttons, notably the number pad and the cursor keys, seem so hollow that they rattle a little and might be more extensive. Brightness control for the backlight is also absent. The R and E keys, positioned backward with their typeface in yellow to indicate recycling, may also divert the attention of slower typists. The trackpad is adequate, albeit on the mushy side, and there's a fingerprint reader on board.

Because of its low brightness of 270 nits, this panel is suitable for usage exclusively in indoor settings. The display is below par, rendering just 58.1% of an sRGB color space with an average Delta E of 5.16. The screen's dynamic range of 1,350:1 is an improvement, but it's still not great. Compared to the actual world, this panel seems dark and unimpressive. It cannot generate sufficient color to render material in its best light, making it appear not very interesting.

This processor from Tiger Lake has four Hyper-Threaded cores with a maximum Turbo frequency of 4.5GHz per core. The i5-1135G7 is used in most middle-of-the-road laptops, and it is a little sluggish. Due to its usage of Intel's embedded Iris Xe graphics, the Acer computer is limited to playing only fair games. Dual-channel memory with 8 G.B. of space is included. You receive a 512GB SSD in the U.K. but just 256GB in the U.S. Compared to the more common i5-1135G7, the processor's single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores at 1,446 and 4,821, respectively, are significant improvements. That's fast enough to multitask efficiently, using a suite of office programs, several browser windows, or a simple picture editor. While the read and writing speeds of the SSD are only ordinary at 2,347MB/s and 1,173MB/s, respectively, they are sufficient to make the laptop snappy.</p><p><br></p><p>When it comes to heat retention, it holds its own as well. Even after rigorous stress testing, the outside stayed comfortably cold, and the maximum noise level was a quiet whoosh from the fan. The Vero's Core i5 CPU isn't flawless, but it should be enough for most uses. The Acer's PC Mark 10 score of 4,544 is approximately 1,000 points away from the theoretical maximum for this processor. The chip's top performance was capped at 3.5GHz even when subjected to intensive multi-threaded workloads. The lower PC Mark 10 score may be attributed to the processor operating at 800MHz below its multi-threaded boost peak. That also implies this laptop isn't up to handling intensive creative projects.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Features/Performance","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":995,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433125081.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The 48Wh battery is standard on the Acer Aspire Vero. It's not a minor thing. It isn't a huge thing. It's standard fare for a notebook of this sort, as with several other design aspects. A reasonable amount of stamina, but not much else. It lasted for 6 hours and 56 minutes in our video rundown test. Still, we found that under normal conditions of light document writing and occasional web surfing, its battery life may dip to just below 5 hours. In addition, the amount of power it wasted while slowly freezing outside with the screen at maximum brightness showed a full charge would last around four hours. The battery life of the Acer Vero is commensurate with its status as a semi-portable laptop. We have found that laptops with just an AMD Ryzen processor tend to survive longer, so Acer might have fared better with one.</p><p><br></p><p>In terms of connectivity, it should meet the demands of the vast majority of users. You may plug in a mouse to the one USB 2.0 port on the right. On the lateral side, you'll find the remaining links. There is a USB-C connector, and it can transfer data at 5Gbps. In addition to the two USB 3.0 ports, the traditional full-size HDMI port, and the Ethernet jack, this device also has an S.D. card reader. The Acer Aspire Vero's battery may be charged through the traditional cylindrical connector, freeing up the USB-C port for other needs. The obvious thing lacking is an S.D. card slot. Still, if you're a photographer needing memory card compatibility, you shouldn't purchase the Vero due to its poor color accuracy.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Battery Life","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":996,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433133675.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The battery life of this environmentally friendly laptop from <b>Acer</b> is sufficient for a full day of classes, lasting around 12 hours while playing media and between 7 and 8 hours when doing typical tasks. As far as performance goes, the Vero holds up rather well, given the price. It's more expensive rivals, such as the Apple Mac Pro 13 and Air, the Dell Inspiron 13, and H.P. Envy 13, provides longer battery life.

The Core i7 model retails for $849 in the U.S. and £849 inside the U.K., while the Core i5 variant can be had for $584 in the U.S. and £649. They are unbelievable bargains if you're a college student on a tight budget. The MacBook Pro 13 begins at $1,299/£1,349, while the MacBook Air can be purchased for $1,199/£999. The XPS 13 from Dell starts at $999 or £949, so Apple isn't the only company charging a premium.
