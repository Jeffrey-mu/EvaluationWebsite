      "content": "<p>This model&#39;s clever design makes it easy and enjoyable to grill on the move, with features such as side tables that fold up and cooking grates that are simple to clean.</p><p><br/></p><p>The <b>Weber</b> Q1200 is a wonderful compact grill with great temperature control and a wide cooking surface that is more than enough to accommodate a hungry family of four or a group of friends tailgating together. And despite its weight, it is incredibly sturdy and can withstand a wide range of wind speeds without being affected.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>+\tSide tables that come in handy</p><p>+\tCast-iron cooking grates with a porcelain coating and a brushed finish</p><p>+\tVery wind-resistant</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>- Heavy for a <b>grill</b> that can be carried around</p><p>- A tiny bit on the pricey side</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Key Specs</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>· <b>Main Burner BTU:</b> \t8,500</p><p>· <b>Number Of Burners:</b> \t1</p><p>· <b>Dimensions:</b> \t\t24 x 40 x 20 in &#40;lid open&#41;</p><p>· <b>Primary Cooking Space:</b> 192 sq in</p><p>· <b>Burner Material:</b> \tStainless steel</p><p>· <b>Weight:</b> \t\t31 lbs.</p><p>· <b>Product Warranty:</b> \t5 years &#40;limited&#41;</p><p>· <b>Burner Warranty:</b> \t5 years</p><p><br/></p><p>With gas grills, Weber hopes to prove with the <b>Q1200</b> that size isn&#39;t as important as it once was. This compact tabletop barbeque from Weber has the same classic design and high-quality construction that have become synonymous with the brand&#39;s stationary barbecues. The barbecue is equipped with a single burner, an electronic ignition powered by a battery, and two side tables that fold out of the way. The cooking surface of 192 square inches is just right for couples or small families, and the grill&#39;s compact size makes it suitable for outdoor cooking in confined areas such as the balcony of an apartment building or for transporting in the trunk of a vehicle while going away from home.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Design</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>One of the great things about the Weber Q1200 is that it is available in six different colors. The cooking grates are made of cast iron with a porcelain covering, and they perform their task well by providing a flavorful and uniform heat throughout the cooking process. In addition, they are simple to clean, which is always an important factor for us.</p><p><br/></p><p>We are unsure whether it is portable given its substantial weight of roughly 31 pounds and its fairly distinctive form that contributes to its fashionable street cred. There is a possibility that you may transport it onto your balcony or porch, move it about your yard, place it in the trunk of your vehicle, or take it with you when you travel in an RV; nevertheless, we do not anticipate that you will take it with you on a trek in the near future. It&#39;s an attractive piece of study equipment, and with a guarantee that lasts for five years, we should anticipate that it will serve us well if we take care of it.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Resistance to the Wind</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p>The Q 1200&#39;s dome-shaped lid effectively blocks the wind, so even in the strongest gusts, the flame is unaffected, even when the thermostat is set to its lowest level. Even though it is not necessarily insulated, the heavier-weight cast aluminum cover is well-suited to maintain crucial heat as outside temp drops. On the other hand, Piezo igniters are known to be temperamental in cold weather, but the electronic igniting system is completely reliable.</p><p><br/></p><p>The only thing that may be considered a nuisance in the breeze is the disposable aluminum drip tray liner. This liner&#39;s only purpose is to save the user from having to clean the drip tray, which is well known to be the dirtiest section of a grill. If you don&#39;t add considerable weight to this drip pan, like a boulder, you may anticipate that it will pick up and fly away with the first strong gust of wind coming around.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>One burner on the grill makes it easy to barbecue with little hassle. The side tables on either side make it much simpler to store the product. A tiny grill like this one would benefit from having side tables; alternatively, you could buy a stand to go with it. The grill may also be placed on a table.</p><p><br/></p><p>The grill is powered by the little gas tanks, which can be easily attached to the base with a simple screw, and it seems to be quite fuel-efficient overall. If, on the other hand, you plan to use it as your primary grill in your backyard or on your balcony, we believe it will be worthwhile to invest in the converter kit and hose to connect to a regular-size gas bottle so that you can save money on acquiring an ongoing supply of the portable ones.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Setup</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The Q1200 arrives in a large package considering it is just a tabletop grill. However, putting it together is a piece of cake; all it takes is a quick trip to your neighborhood Weber dealer to get one, and then you&#39;ll be back at your house and ready to start cooking in no time. After that, you have to screw on the handles, put in the cooking grate, and screw in the gas, and you&#39;re ready to go. All you have to do is put on the handles. Easy enough for even the least technically savvy people to understand.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Performance</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The Q1200 is excellent for straightforward grilling for two people or a small family. There is no chance for indirect cooking due to the small size of the cooking area and the fact that there is only one burner, so even if there were room, it is unlikely that you would be roasting a whole chicken. If only two of you are using it, you can quickly throw on your meat and add some vegetables on the side; this makes it ideal for a speedy meal to have ready when you get home from work.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671502824764.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>When we opened the lid of the Q1200, the temperature fell significantly, and it took quite some time for the temperature to return to normal once we had closed the youngster again. We are happy to report that a griddle plate that fits half the grill is available for purchase. This allows for some adaptation with such a tiny grill and makes it feasible for RV campers to have breakfast outside.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Q1200 includes grease tray compatible with disposable foil trays. These trays may be purchased separately from Weber. These may be purchased with little effort on the internet, but we discovered we could scrape them out and put them in the dishwasher.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Maintenance</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The rear tables on the Weber Q1200 fold upwards to save some room when storing it, and if you need to keep it outdoors, there is an optional high-quality cover that can be purchased if you need to protect it from the elements.</p><p><br/></p><p>As the Q1200 is being preheated, it is recommended by Weber&#39;s online expert to do a &#34;burn-off.&#34; He explains, &#34;I&#39;ll put it on high for about 15 minutes, until the temperature reaches to somewhere between 500 and 600 degrees, and then I&#39;ll open it up and brush the grate with a clean stainless steel brush.&#34; When brushing, one should always work in the direction of the apertures in the burner.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Price</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Although it is not inexpensive, the Weber Q1200 is not the most costly grill on the market. For example, the Napoleon TravelQ 285 Portable Gas BBQ Grill is expensive, around one hundred dollars. It does offer a bigger cooking surface, two distinct burners, and has an option for a griddle, which means that you are getting more for your money.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>User Reviews</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>According to one of the reviews, the Weber Q1200 packs quite a punch for a portable grill: &#34;This bad boy gets up to 500 degrees in no time flat and performs like its much larger relatives with a substantially smaller footprint.&#34; It shouldn&#39;t be difficult to cook a steak over a medium-rare heat setting perfectly. There is plenty of space for two people to cook a whole dinner together, including both meat and vegetables. It should be possible to fit four steaks of a respectable size here.</p><p><br/></p><p>The grill&#39;s performance in windy situations is mentioned in the critical reviews, namely as follows: &#34;Windy conditions will use up a lot more as the instructions indicate.&#34; This would be a fantastic grill if Weber increased the BTUs so that rare and medium rare temperatures could be achieved on steaks and patties of a thinner thickness.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Weber Q1200 vs. Q2200</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The Q1200 and its more experienced sibling, the Q2200, are included in the Weber Q series of compact grills. They vary only in terms of size and cost. They are quite similar otherwise. The Q2200 is just bigger in every way compared to the Q1200. It has a cooking surface that is 50% larger, has greater power &#40;3.5 KW&#41;, weighs 19 kg, which is much more, and costs significantly more. The Q2200 is the most cost-effective choice if you need a grill that can accommodate four or six people, whether your family or a group of friends.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How Easy Is It To Carry Around?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>For some people, the Q1200 will provide the ideal balance of portability, while it will be an unqualified disappointment for others. It uses 14- or 16-ounce disposable propane tanks as a fuel source. Weber has an auxiliary adapter and hose that will allow you to connect a much cheaper and refillable 20-pound propane cylinder. In addition, a kit available on the aftermarket enables you to adapt a Q grill to use the low-pressure quick-disconnect line in your RV.</p><p><br/></p><p>In our opinion, a significant disadvantage prevents it from being portable. It weighs around 30 lbs and is difficult to move about without wheels because of its weight and size. It has a cumbersome and ungainly quality right out of the packaging. It is not the grill you would be prepared to transport for a significant distance. A stand may be used, making it much simpler to transport. But after shelling out more cash for what is essentially a stationary Weber Q, a stand may not seem like such a good idea. Or it could. We think it depends on how much more appealing a Weber Q1200 is to you than any other grill.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671502841221.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How Environmentally Friendly Is The Weber Q1200?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>It seemed like excessive plastic and polystyrene packing arrived with this. In addition, it has side tables manufactured out of plastic rather than a more long-lasting and environmentally friendly material.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Because this is a rather tiny and compact BBQ, the pricing is on the higher end of what you&#39;d expect to spend, particularly because the guarantee is limited to five years. Despite this, the fact that it bears the Weber name ensures that it is crafted with components of a high standard, and you can have faith that it will provide a satisfactory level of performance.</p><p><br/></p><p>This model does not come with bells and whistles, yet, it has a fashionable appearance and is an excellent choice for couples or small families. It allows you to enjoy all the freedom and excitement of cooking outside without the worry or mess of charcoal or a bigger, more bulky gas grill.</p>",
