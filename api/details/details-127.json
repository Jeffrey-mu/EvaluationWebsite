Compared to our previous recommendation, it produces greater heat and has roomier built-in side tables. The summertime is at its best when you can sit outside and enjoy the weather while munching on a juicy burger that has been seared to perfection. The excitement might wilt out quickly if the grill isn't up to snuff. To help you maintain the good times (and the food), we've searched for gas grills that are resilient, simple to clean, and straightforward to use. Our study and experience with seven of the best grills on the market and many more led us to conclude that the Weber Spirit II E-310 is the best option for grilling meat and poultry. Its performance, convenience, longevity, and cost-effectiveness are unparalleled among grills.

This compact tabletop barbeque from Weber has the same classic design and high-quality construction that have become synonymous with the brand's stationary barbecues. The barbecue is equipped with a single burner, an electronic ignition powered by a battery, and two side tables that fold out of the way. The cooking surface of 192 square inches is just right for couples or small families, and the grill's compact size makes it suitable for outdoor cooking in confined areas such as the balcony of an apartment building or for transporting in the trunk of a vehicle while going away from home.</p><p><br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Key Specs","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":812,"content":"<p>One of the great things about the Weber Q1200 is that it is available in six different colors. The cooking grates are made of cast iron with a porcelain covering, and they perform their task well by providing a flavorful and uniform heat throughout the cooking process. In addition, they are simple to clean, which is always an important factor for us.<br></p><p><br></p><p>We are unsure whether it is portable given its substantial weight of roughly 31 pounds and its fairly distinctive form that contributes to its fashionable street cred. There is a possibility that you may transport it onto your balcony or porch, move it about your yard, place it in the trunk of your vehicle, or take it with you when you travel in an RV; nevertheless, we do not anticipate that you will take it with you on a trek in the near future. It's an attractive piece of study equipment, and with a guarantee that lasts for five years, we should anticipate that it will serve us well if we take care of it.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Resistance to the Wind</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>The Q 1200's dome-shaped lid effectively blocks the wind, so even in the strongest gusts, the flame is unaffected, even when the thermostat is set to its lowest level. Even though it is not necessarily insulated, the heavier-weight cast aluminum cover is well-suited to maintain crucial heat as outside temp drops. On the other hand, Piezo igniters are known to be temperamental in cold weather, but the electronic igniting system is completely reliable.</p><p><br></p><p>The only thing that may be considered a nuisance in the breeze is the disposable aluminum drip tray liner. This liner's only purpose is to save the user from having to clean the drip tray, which is well known to be the dirtiest section of a grill. If you don't add considerable weight to this drip pan, like a boulder, you may anticipate that it will pick up and fly away with the first strong gust of wind coming around.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Design","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":813,"content":"<p>One burner on the grill makes it easy to barbecue with little hassle.

After that, you have to screw on the handles, put in the cooking grate, and screw in the gas, and you're ready to go. All you have to do is put on the handles.

There is plenty of space for two people to cook a whole dinner together, including both meat and vegetables. It should be possible to fit four steaks of a respectable size here.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The grill's performance in windy situations is mentioned in the critical reviews, namely as follows: \"Windy conditions will use up a lot more as the instructions indicate.\" This would be a fantastic grill if Weber increased the BTUs so that rare and medium rare temperatures could be achieved on steaks and patties of a thinner thickness.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"User Reviews","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":819,"content":"<p>The Q1200 and its more experienced sibling, the Q2200, are included in the Weber Q series of compact grills.

It has a cooking surface that is 50% larger, has greater power (3.5 KW), weighs 19 kg, which is much more, and costs significantly more.

In addition, a kit available on the aftermarket enables you to adapt a Q grill to use the low-pressure quick-disconnect line in your RV.<br></p><p><br></p><p>In our opinion, a significant disadvantage prevents it from being portable. It weighs around 30 lbs and is difficult to move about without wheels because of its weight and size. It has a cumbersome and ungainly quality right out of the packaging. It is not the grill you would be prepared to transport for a significant distance. A stand may be used, making it much simpler to transport. But after shelling out more cash for what is essentially a stationary Weber Q, a stand may not seem like such a good idea. Or it could.
