When glasses slip down the nose, for instance, the optical centers of the lenses are no longer in alignment with the wearer's pupils. Consequently, the eyes will not benefit from the full potential of the lens prescription. Also, those who wear glasses with sliding frames may develop the annoying habit of continually adjusting the frames' placement on their noses. Both of these issues may be corrected by having either temple length adjusted or having the fit of the temple tips from around the ears adjusted by an eye optician. Also, the nose pads may be swapped out for ones that provide a more comfortable fit or a firmer grip. Glasses are a great way to express your individuality and sense of style. Specialists at REGIONAL EYE OPTICAL seem to be delighted to assist you in choosing frames that highlight your best facial characteristics.</p>",
