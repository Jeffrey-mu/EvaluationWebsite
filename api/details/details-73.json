They have high-definition (4K or 8K) displays with high dynamic range (HDR) and a wealth of other capabilities, such as HDMI 2.1 inputs, 120Hz support, as well as Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) for the newest PCs, but also game consoles.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">A large screen is usually unnecessary if the TV is in a bedroom. Also, if the room you plan on placing the TV in is very bright, you may want to buy a high-end LCD TV instead of a cheaper LCD TV or an OLED TV. Before you begin your search, this foundational knowledge will streamline the process and help you focus on the most relevant possibilities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">If you want a new TV but are confused by all the terminology, our TV buying guide is here to help. Shopping for such a new TV today is less about avoiding faulty lemon rather than avoiding paying for expensive features you aren't interested in or won't use. The good news is that even budget TVs typically look fine if you want the basics. You should ask yourself specific questions such as, \"What kind of stuff am I going to watch?\" How big of a screen do we need to fit in this space? To what extent do you have management over supplementary sources of light, such as lamps but instead of windows? A 120 Hz free sync TV, is more expensive but unnecessary if you don't play video games or see Blu-rays regularly.</span></p><p><br></p></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":222,"content":"<p><br></p><h2><b>1.

To find something out, check out our entire piece of the 2022 C-Series OLED, the C2. Most viewers probably won't even notice a difference in visual quality between the two.</p><p>The C1 is nearly on par with the LG G1 and offers more bang for the buck than the vast majority of TVs we've examined. The LG C1 OLED is available in five sizes, a more significant number than you'll discover in the LG G1 series, the C1's pricier, fancier older sibling. It's fantastic performance and future-facing capabilities make it easily one of the best TVs we've ever seen. Both lines have larger screen sizes (55\", 65\", and 77\"). However, the LG C1 also has a more manageable (and affordable) 48\" option. We anticipate this trend to continue as LG introduces its 2022 collection of televisions because sales have been so strong since the TV's original debut.</p><p>The C1 ships with webOS, LG's newest innovative platform, and a new version of the company's body movement Magic Remote. However, the C1 does not utilize LG's newest \"OLED Evo\" panel technology. The LG G1 is the only phone worth buying if you want such a function. Our analysis suggests, however, that the added cost may not be warranted in your case.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><p><br></p><h2><br></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"329","score":"4.5","subtitle":"Best TV 2022","amazon_adv":[{"id":329,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671505786008.jpeg","title":"The LG ","original_price":"$1,499.99","actual_price":" $1,249.00","specifications":"C1 OLED TV","link":"https://amzn.to/3USFj9O","description":""}]},{"id":396,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>2.

The TV's Mini LED backlighting allows for deeper blacks thanks to improved local dimming; it can also be dimmed down to a usable level and yet get quite bright, making it suitable for either reducing glare or bringing out highlights.</p><p>The new remote is solar-powered, and the Tizen innovative platform it runs on is user-friendly and includes various downloadable applications.One of the first displays to use Samsung's much-touted Neo QLED solar cells in 2021 is the QN90A Neo QLED, which boasts a higher ratio of emission photons diodes per square inch than previous generations. It includes many gaming highlights like variable frame rates (VRR) support but rather HDMI 2.1 bandwidth.
