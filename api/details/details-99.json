The 2nd Hammerhead has now become available, and despite entering a crowded market, they are still somewhat intriguing at around $130, thanks to some welcome upgrades from Razer. Recently, Razer has been developing a more comprehensive range of lifestyle items, with the Razer Opus headphones standing out. Here we look at the Razer Hammerhead True <b>Wireless earbuds</b>, the company's newest wireless incarnation of a product they've been selling for a while now.

They provide enhanced sound quality by isolating the ear canal and may be customized in minute or extreme ways with accompanying software. The glowing, multicolored LED panels help the headphones conform to the brand's style on the outer earpieces; these panels' colors and patterns are customizable through an accompanying app. Active noise cancellation (ANC) seems surprising, not a selling factor, because of its lackluster performance. While other wireless earbuds in this price bracket provide somewhat better value, the second-generation Hammerhead True Wireless in-ears are an excellent option for Razer fans.</p><p><br></p><p>The newer, improved Razer Hammerhead True Wireless headphones are worth the extra $30 over the originals in many respects.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+ Easy on the eyes and the body.</p><p>+ \"Gaming\" mode with low latency.</p><p>+ LEDs have practical applications.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>- Unfortunately, the touch controls are sluggish and sometimes unreliable.</p><p>- There are two applications needed to operate all of the functionality.</p><p>- ANC's benefits are minimal at best.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Specifications:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><b>Drivers:</b> 13 mm</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 45 grams</p><p><b>Battery:</b> 275mAh battery</p><p><b>Frequency response:</b> 20 Hz - 20kHz</p><p><b>Audio codecs:</b> AAC, SBC</p><p><b>Case dimensions:</b> 64 x 50 x 25 mm</p><p><b>Wireless:</b> Yes</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Specs For The Razer Hammerhead True Wireless (2nd Gen)","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":979,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432851398.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The new <b>Hammerhead earphones</b> from Razer don't look much like the original model; instead, they borrow heavily from the Pro variant released last year. The new Hammerheads seem identical; the only distinguishing feature is the coating. The Pro version had a matte surface that wouldn't reflect light, while the new Hammerheads are shiny. The overall form and most other critical aesthetic aspects have not changed. Long sticks protrude from the bottom of the earbuds, allowing them to fit snugly into the ear canal. The body's rear is a touch-sensitive panel branded with the Razer emblem, and it has the brand's trademark multicolored LEDs at long last.</p><p><br></p><p>Touch controls work nicely, although the press-and-hold action often requires just the right amount of time. The timing wasn't hard to master, but I still can't pull off the play/pause switch without a few tries. The fit is excellent, and I can listen for long periods without discomfort. You can get a decent seal with the assistance of interchangeable polyurethane tips, and they're snug enough to prevent sound from leaking in or out, but I wouldn't call them secure. A little jolt may shake them loose, and any motion will finally do the trick. Even when sitting, sometimes one or both would come free, but at least I could still feel them dangling from my ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The carrying case has the same design as the Pro version, but like the earbuds, it is matte rather than glossy. It doesn't feel very high-end, and the lid makes a creaking plastic noise now and again, but those are minor flaws. Sliding the buds into the Case at first may be difficult since the sticks need to be positioned just the right way, but with time and practice, you'll get the hang of it. Those who would instead not use a wired connection to charge their device may be disappointed to learn that simply the bottom Type-C port remains supported. Besides the Case and the earbuds, the packing consists of a 12-inch braided USB A-to-C cable, a short handbook, and three pairs of replaceable silicone tips in various sizes.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"What's In The Package, The Design, And The Hardware","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":980,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432860713.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>It's crucial to note that the Hammerheads' factory settings are far from optimal before discussing sound quality. The default EQ settings made them sound flat and unbalanced, but after playing with them for a while, I found an environment that was perfect for me, and I ended up creating a profile I've been using ever since. Additionally, the parameters are carried over across pairings by the buds. When adjusted properly, the sound is on par with other headphones in its price range. Clear vocals and a satisfying spectrum of tones characterize this recording. Most listeners will be pleased with the sound profile, but dedicated audiophiles who want an immersive sound staging and highly crisp audio will be disappointed, as will enthusiasts of skull-rattling bass.</p><p><br></p><p>Razer's low-latency mode, which guarantees a delay of fewer than 60 milliseconds, is a standout feature for gaming or viewing videos on devices that don't support audio synchronizing. And it works rather well, with a delay only perceptible to the most vigilant observer. Keep in mind that any disruption to the wireless connection might cause the audio to become garbled or out of sync for short periods. Some users will be dissatisfied that the headphones do not include a sensor to know when they have been removed from the ear. I don't think many people worry about this, and the fact that it's not included doesn't bother me too much, but it seems like it ought to be on any pair of earbuds that costs more than $100.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks to its support for Fast Pair, opening Bluetooth settings no longer needs a second set of taps. The pairing mode can only be initiated if both buds are in the Case or if the device with which they were previously linked cannot be accessed. While most people obviously won't mind, I find it a little cumbersome to take out my earbud, drop it in the container to pair, then take it out again to put it back in my ear. I guess active noise cancellation does exist, but it isn't perfect. To begin with, it is only half as successful as other earbuds in reducing low-frequency sounds, and it doesn't do an excellent job of completely blocking out ambient noise.</p><p><br></p><p>But it's overshadowed by a problem gradually lowering the ANC, generally becoming apparent after 30–45 minutes of use. As soon as you've used ANC for a little over an hour, you may as well have turned it off. The Hammerheads do a great job on calls, producing a clear and sharp sound. You can manage your ring with a few pushes on the earbuds themselves, eliminating the need to use your phone for anything besides volume adjustments. What I didn't count on was how much the listeners would appreciate the sound quality I was able to provide. Every person I've talked with while wearing these headphones has made the unprompted observation that my voice sounds fantastic. These days, I feel like I have to utilize them on every call.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Battery Life, Features, And Audio Quality","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":981,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432873312.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>While the Razer Audio accompanying app isn't strictly required to utilize the headphones, it is highly recommended to do so, if only to tweak the settings and adjust the sound profile. Moreover, the software lets you customize each bud independently and remap different activities to different touch combinations. The only thing lacking is a button combo to adjust the volume up or down. To change the LED behavior, you'll need to download the oddly-named \"Razer Chroma RGB\" companion software.</p><p><br></p><p>Using different colored lights may seem like a gimmick, and sometimes it is, but I now understand its potential benefits. The LEDs can be set to blink while audio is playing, alerting passersby that you may not be able to hear them if they try to speak to you and making your buds easier to find if they're dropped in the dark. The visual effects may be turned off if they bother you.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"LEDs And Software","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":982,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432883189.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The second generation Hammerhead True Wireless headphones are a glossy black. The Razer logo is illuminated on LED panels at the earpieces' end. With the accompanying software, you may slow down or speed up the LEDs' transition from purple to red through yellow to green. Like many shiny earphones, stem-shaped earpieces may be challenging to remove from the charging Case. Even though the earbuds are on the larger side, they fit snugly and comfortably for extended listening sessions. Silicone ear tips in three different sizes are included. The matte black exterior and flip-top cover of the Case make it far less slippery. The bottom accepts the USB-C to USB-A charging cable, braided black fabric.
