      "description": "Typically, debt settlement agencies will negotiate with your creditors to reduce the amount you owe them. Although this service has a lot of potential benefits, it also has a high chance of failure, damaging effects on your credit, and a high price tag. Due to the high stakes involved, debt settlement is often the last choice. If this is your only choice, you must do business with a dependable provider. The finest debt settlement agencies are honest about their rates, have a solid track record of satisfied customers, and have been vetted by a regulatory body such as the American Fair Credit Council &#40;AFCC&#41;.

      "content": "<p>No matter what kind of computer or mobile device, Norton <b>LifeLock</b> is one of the most reliable identity theft protection programs available today.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Norton</b> LifeLock is an excellent identity theft protection application that will make you feel more secure while you are online due to its features. The free VPN and unusually long 60-day guarantee are also wonderful additional features.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>+\t60-day guarantee</p><p>+\tEasy-to-use controls</p><p>+\tFree VPN</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>- Expensive</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Key Specs</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>· Free trial</p><p>· Average email response time</p><p>· Up to one million dollars in coverage for <b>identity theft</b> insurance</p><p>· Stolen money reimbursement: up to $1 million</p><p>· Offer of special value</p><p>· The highest cost monthly</p><p>· Monitoring of one&#39;s credit</p><p>· Notifications for investment accounts</p><p>· Social media monitoring</p><p>· Monitoring of the home&#39;s title</p><p>· Distribution of addresses</p><p>· Dark web surveillance</p><p>· Monitoring of criminal activity in your name</p><p>· Reports on one&#39;s credit</p><p>· Score of credit</p><p><br/></p><p>At this time, Norton LifeLock is considered to be among the most effective identity theft protection services. Therefore, for most levels, you get online protection in addition to features such as a free VPN. In addition to assisting in preventing identity theft in real time, LifeLock can assist in the restoration of your digital life in the event the worst should occur.</p><p><br/></p><p>Suppose sensitive information about you, such as your credit card number or Social Security number, falls into the wrong hands; invest in Norton LifeLock&#39;s monitoring of over 10,000 recognized websites and the dark web for instances of those data appearing. Is money well spent &#40;in the wrong hands&#41;?</p><p><br/></p><p>However, there is a possibility that this information will not be disclosed due to a breach of personal security. Large corporations often have data breaches, which may result in the exposure of your personal information. For this reason, it is beneficial to have protection so that you are aware when you are under attack rather than discovering this information when it may be too late to do something about it.</p><p><br/></p><p>That is precisely what Norton LifeLock does: it assists in protecting you by having a team of actual people ready to leap into action whenever required. However, it is important to remember that no ID theft protection service can promise that the information you supply will be kept completely secure since that is not how their systems operate.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Plans and Pricing</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The price is one of the customers&#39; primary concerns with Norton LifeLock, an otherwise excellent product. Not only is it possible that this product may cost you a lot of money – although it will not cost you nearly as much as having your identity stolen – the plans themselves are tough to dissect and comprehend. Because there is an excessive number of paid levels from which to choose, the final result is too complicated.</p><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock may also be purchased as a packaged component of the antivirus software known as Norton 360 adds additional complexity to the situation. As seen in the picture on the right, the three levels are as follows: Select, which begins at $8.99 a year; Advantage, which begins at $17.99; and Ultimate Plus, which begins at $25.99 per year.</p><p><br/></p><p>After the first year, these prices will increase to $11.99, $24.99, and $34.99, respectively. Choosing Select gives you coverage of up to $25,000, along with monitoring your credit, social security number, and identity. You get protection on up to five devices and a free VPN.</p><p><br/></p><p>The insurance maximum for Advantage is increased to $100,000; it is compatible with ten different devices and monitors for bank fraud if someone commits a crime using your identity. You also receive priority live member assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week, reports from a sex offender registry, notifications if someone takes over your bank account, and more. The Ultimate Plus package for LifeLock includes access to credit bureau monitoring for three devices, one million dollars’ worth of protection, protection for 401&#40;k&#41; accounts, and unlimited device connections.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Every one of Norton LifeLock&#39;s subscription tiers comes with a Virtual Private Network &#40;VPN&#41;, and if you&#39;re looking for comprehensive online protection, we strongly advise using this option. In a nutshell, if you don&#39;t have a virtual private network &#40;VPN&#41;, inputting your banking and credit card information, even to verify it, puts you in a vulnerable situation. A VPN hides your IP address, making the process safer.</p><p><br/></p><p>You won&#39;t have to wait for a credit report to find out if you&#39;ve been attacked since Norton LifeLock&#39;s Ultimate Plus tier includes 401&#40;k&#41; monitoring and credit bureau monitoring. This is a highly beneficial feature. Instead, this will promptly inform you of any crimes that have been committed using your name, and it will also have the Norton team ready to begin trying to reclaim your identity.</p><p><br/></p><p>Suppose the worst-case scenario occurs, and a thief obtains and uses your personal information. In that case, the identity recovery specialists at Norton LifeLock will assist you in getting back on track. Unlike other, less expensive services, they do more than tell you who to call in this situation. Because these customer service representatives are accessible around the clock, you may feel at ease investing in any of the offered plan levels.</p><p><br/></p><p>This indicates that they can handle the laborious job of making those calls for you, increasing the likelihood that the breach may be fixed without any more action being required.</p><p><br/></p><p>A cloud backup option is available on all levels, and it provides a respectable 100 GB of storage space for Windows personal computers. In addition, there is a parental protection system and a password manager that are both built-in.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition, there is a parental protection system and a password manager that are both built-in. We enjoy the Childwatch protection that IdentityForce provides, one of the few reasons Norton Lifelock isn&#39;t exactly at the top of our list. Even though it is packed with features, we prefer the protection that IdentityForce provides.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Credit Scores and Identity Monitoring</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock excels the most in identity theft prevention compared to credit monitoring as a service offering. Before the summer of 2021, LifeLock&#39;s highest-tier Ultimate Plus plan only provided one credit report per year from any of the Big Three credit bureaus. This report was identical to the one you could get for free from annualcreditreport.com. LifeLock has since improved this feature, but it is still inferior to the free report.</p><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock likely became aware that its competitors provided more frequent credit reports and scores than it did. As a result, in June 2021, the company increased the frequency of Equifax credit reports and scores for subscribers of LifeLock Advantage to once per month, and it increased the frequency to once per day for subscribers of LifeLock Ultimate Plus. Ultimate Plus customers will now get their monthly credit reports and scores from Experian and TransUnion.</p><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock searches the open and &#34;dark&#34; portions of the internet for more than one hundred personal data, including your name, Social Security number, email address, street address, and even gamer tags. This search is intended to protect your identity.</p><p><br/></p><p>There is also a service known as House Title Monitoring, which checks for indications that someone is attempting to remove or add your name from a property deed or home title or that they are seeking to refinance the mortgage on your property. If you already have LifeLock Ultimate Plus, this service is already included. If not, you may subscribe to Home Title Monitoring as a separate service for a one-time fee of $100 per year.</p><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock Ultimate Plus received a new feature called Social Media Monitoring in February of 2022. This feature monitors your Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube accounts. It looks for indications of account takeover, such as odd postings or changes to account settings, as well as potentially harmful links in the news feed and indications of cyberbullying behavior for users under 18.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671503408707.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Your bank, investment, and credit card accounts are monitored by LifeLock Ultimate Plus, in addition to watching for address changes made by the United States Postal Service and verifying your information with payday loan businesses and online peer-to-peer lending operations.</p><p><br/></p><p>It may notify you if there is odd activity on your bank accounts or if there are changes to the charges that are made on a recurrent basis. Additionally, it monitors people-search websites such as Spokeo and Intellius for any signals that your name or other data may appear an abnormally high number of times.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Notifications and Warnings</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The warnings provided by LifeLock may be sent to you through email, text message, or phone call. Alternatively, they may be shown in the online interface or the mobile application. The levels at which alerts are generated may be changed so that they do not cause you to get overwhelmed or lead you to miss crucial messages.</p><p><br/></p><p>LifeLock can alert you of account takeovers, incorrect loans, and known sexual offenders residing in the area, in addition to informing you of issues with investments, bank accounts, and credit cards.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition, LifeLock will let you know if there has been a data breach at your bank or the company that issues your credit cards if your password has been included on a list of stolen credentials that is being sold online, and, as was previously mentioned, if someone is attempting to steal your mobile phone number.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>A Guide to Purchasing LifeLock</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><h3><b>Choose a Plan</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p>On the LifeLock website, a comparison tool allows users to examine the benefits of each of the three available plans – Standard, Advantage, and Ultimate Plus – laid out side-by-side. Examine the several plans available to you to choose the one that caters most closely to your requirements.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Create an Account</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p>To become a member of LifeLock, you will first need to register for an account on their website. To begin, you will need to create an account by providing your name, email address, physical address, and phone number in addition to a strong password of your selection.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Enter Your Personal Information</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p>Your date of birth, credit and bank account numbers, Social Security number, and access to your credit reports are some of the personally identifiable information that LifeLock will request from you throughout the enrollment process. This is necessary so that the service may check your data for any signs of potentially fraudulent activity.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Would You Recommend Norton Lifelock To A Friend?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Norton LifeLock is an excellent choice for protecting one&#39;s identity from theft, and it is a useful product for anybody looking for all-inclusive protection. You will, however, be required to pay for the highest-end plan to have the most all-encompassing coverage. This may not be the most cost-effective choice for you, given that some of the other providers provide many of these services even in their most basic plans. If you want to save a few bucks, you may do it by purchasing something like ID Watchdog, which is a few dollars less expensive.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671503422389.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How Difficult Is It To Make Use Of Norton LifeLock?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Norton LifeLock&#39;s goal is to take what might be a complicated and intimidating system and make it incredibly approachable and, dare we say it, nice. It performs this job very well. It&#39;s true that you still have that brilliant Norton yellow all over the place, which makes you feel a little on edge, but isn&#39;t that the point?</p><p><br/></p><p>You can begin at the highest possible level and navigate down to the Privacy area, for instance, where you may configure your phone and credit card. This is a simple task that can be completed in a short amount of time. Alternatively, you may go a bit further into your personally identifiable information to better understand how effectively you are protected.</p>",
