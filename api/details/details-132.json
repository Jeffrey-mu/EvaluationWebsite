Typically, annual deductibles range from $50 to $100, while monthly premiums stay below $50. In most cases, dental insurance will cover the cost of checkups and cleanings, 80 percent of more routine procedures like fillings, and 50 percent of more extensive ones like dental implants. We looked into the market and found that the top five dental insurance companies in the United States are Delta Dental, Renaissance, Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare. The monthly premiums, yearly deductibles, copayments and coinsurance, benefits and services covered, carry permits and other limitations, and the dimensions and geographical scope of health plans are all taken into account in this summary of dental insurance plans.
