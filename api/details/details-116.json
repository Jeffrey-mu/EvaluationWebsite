A new over-the-range &#40;OTR&#41; microwave may be purchased for as low as $200 &#40;not counting installation costs, which can add another $100 or more&#41;. If the price of your new microwave is above a particular threshold, some stores, like Home Depot, will install it for free. The downsides should not be ignored, however. Even while over-the-range microwaves include an exhaust fan, they are not as effective at removing odors and fumes from the kitchen as range hoods. Also, if your microwave is more than 18 inches above your stove, you could have trouble reaching it to retrieve a steaming cup of soup.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671424164135.jpeg","content_id":"204,312,313,314,315","author_id":"7","release_time":"2022-10-12 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-19 12:30:46","update_time":"2022-12-20 15:31:49","entered_by":"admin","topping":"0","score":"","author_introduction":"Lucas Jones is the Technical Editor for Top Ten Reviews.

Whenever it comes to price, the TB25CB is on the pricier end of the spectrum.</p><p><br/></p><p>You may purchase the trimmer for anywhere between $89 and $99. However, compared to other gas-powered trimmers, it is a relatively inexpensive option because it has a 2-cycle fuel motor. The trimmer outperforms its battery-powered competitors in terms of both its power and its longevity.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671437366884.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The TB25CB is a versatile tool that can quickly and easily complete a wide variety of tasks despite its light weight and user-friendliness. A twin-line bump feed head can remove a 16-inch-wide swath of even the toughest weeds in a single pass. Even though it is noisy, the device&#39;s power and adaptability more than makeup for the annoyance caused by the noise.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;5z794&#34;>Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer: Design</h2><p><br/></p><p>Not only is the TB25CB&#39;s layout attractive to the eye, but it also serves a very practical purpose in its construction. The TB25CB is light and straightforward to move with, and it comes in Troy-distinctive Bilt&#39;s red color. </p><p>It boasts a curved shaft which makes it simpler to slide the heads inside tight locations, and it also comes in Troy-signature Bilt&#39;s color. The two-cycle engine is in a small casing that is at the very top of the device. A comfortable handle is located on the shaft of the unit, making it simple to lift and use.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671437378093.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The trimmer has a strong plastic trigger grip located between both the motor and the shaft. This TB25CB has very low vibration and is simple to grip with any of the two provided handles. Particularly helpful is the bent shaft, which allows you to come at plants from above.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;pfwgn&#34;>Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer: Performance</h2><p><br/></p><p>Short version: we couldn&#39;t think of a task that the TB25CB couldn&#39;t complete. We made an effort to do our best. The grass was ultimately out of control, there was a heavy layer of heather and weeds, and there were some wild spreading vines on the chain link fence.</p><p><br/></p><p>If there is one complaint about the TB25CB, it is that it is pretty loud. This is probably a necessary critique. One of the terrible drawbacks of having a powerful engine is that it takes up more space. When operating the TB25CB, we discovered that it was required to either wear a headset that blocked out noise or a quality set of earplugs.</p><p><br/></p><p>Since gas to power the device, the trimmer also produces some exhaust. While we were using the device, we were able to detect the scent of gas burns, but once we turned off the trimmer, there was no trace of that smell left behind.</p><p><br/></p><p>After it gets opened, you may quickly disassemble the cardboard box in which the Troy-Bilt TB25CB gets delivered into its component parts. The trimmer arrives almost wholly put together; the user will need to connect the handles and then cover them before using them. The assembly process is very straightforward and gets completed by a single individual without difficulty. </p><p><br/></p><p>Even though we offer every piece of hardware, it is helpful to have a screwdriver close by so that we can put it all together more quickly. The instructions that come with the machine are easy to understand and to the point.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671437392651.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Before you can start pruning, some preliminary work needs to be clarified first. However, despite the fact that it runs on gas, the trimmer cannot be refueled with ordinary unleaded gasoline. In order for the 2-cycle engine to function effectively, It must use a mixture of gas and oil. When working with a trimmer of this type, the best course of action is to purchase a container with a capacity of one gallon that gets designed solely for the storage of gas for use with this type of trimmer.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;qtz6p&#34;>Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer: Maintenance</h2><p><br/></p><p>Gas-powered tools, in comparison to their battery-operated counterparts, typically require a little more significant amount of maintenance. When using a trimmer such as the TB25CB, one of the most essential items you can do is pay close attention to the fuel, as Ken Deemer, the creator of Local Roots in Pennsylvania.</p><p><br/></p><p>Deemer advised Top Ten Reviews not to make the mistake of using stale gas. This is the most important guideline to follow while working with trimmers of this type. Invest in a dedicated gas can for your trimmer, as that is the best course of action. Prepare gasoline by the gallon; if any gas remains in the trimmer&#39;s tank or the gasoline can by season&#39;s end, it gets discarded without risk. You&#39;ve committed mortal sin if you&#39;ve let the trimmer&#39;s gas lay idle all winter.</p><p><br/></p><p>According to Deemer, using stale gas can be harmful to the engine and lead to decreased performance. In addition to being careful with the gas, he recommended carefully stowing away a gasoline-powered trimmer.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671437412481.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>He advised keeping things dry and cool as the best bet. Consider a garage, a shed, and even a basement. All of those are suitable locations for storing a trimmer. It must vertically keep everything with a gas-powered engine to prevent gasoline from leaking.</p><p><br/></p><p>Deemer claims it takes no time at all to clean the trimmer. He recommended that, after every usage, the trimmer&#39;s cover be sprayed with just a hose to eliminate any grasses or bushes that may have accumulated underneath. The Troy-Bilt TB25CB includes a manufacturer&#39;s guarantee valid for two years and covers any defects that may occur.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;yha7i&#34;>Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer: Price</h2><p><br/></p><p>The TB25CB&#39;s price tag, which approaches $100, makes it one of the most expensive trimmers available. The prices of the comparable units that Craftsman, Black + Decker, and Bolens produce range from $80 to $105, respectively. </p><p><br/></p><p>In general, the majority of trimmers fall within the price range of $80 to $100 and include a number of the exact specifications, including a 16-inch cutting capacity, a 25cc, 2-cycle motor, and a curve shaft.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671437425929.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The TB25CB is neither the most nor the least expensive model in this price range. It falls somewhere in the middle. Nevertheless, it comes equipped with all of the options available on more expensive versions, and it does not appear to be missing in capability. This product is a reliable trimmer that costs close to one hundred dollars.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;erh4o&#34;>Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer: User Reviews</h2><p><br/></p><p>At the time of this writing, some websites have provided positive feedback regarding the Troy-Bilt TB25CB. In total, the trimmer has 284 reviews on Homedepot.com, with 137 of those giving it five stars. Reviews that are favorable point out how simple the assembly process is and how much comfort the curved shaft provides.</p><p><br/></p><p>When asked about his experience with the Troybilt 25CB, one user commented, &#34;It arrived on the weekend, so we decided to do our springtime yard clean-up. Our nearly one-acre yard features curbs, walkways, pavers, planting beds, shrubs, wood, and chains linked fencing lines, plants, and a cobblestone porch. </p><p><br/></p><p>The TB25CB worked superiorly to any other string trimmer that we have ever had, producing a uniform trim with relatively little effort on our part. Controlling the speed is straightforward, and keeping the trim level is not hard either. It is a pleasant trimmer to use, and after a fast refueling, we were back to tackling the winter trash in our yard.&#34; &#34;We used the TB25CB for about two hours with minimal weariness; it is a powerful trimmer that can cut through almost anything.&#34;</p><p><br/></p><p>There have been reports from specific customers that the device will not start. However, the customer service department for the brand has responded to these complaints, and the equipment comes with a warranty that covers defects for two years.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;3kzet&#34;>Should you buy Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer?</h2><p><br/></p><p>This is how we understand it. Even the most persistent plants are no match for this equipment, which gets powered by gas and is reasonably inexpensive. If you are searching for a gas-powered trimmer, the TB25CB is a fantastic piece of machinery, so we strongly suggest you get it if you are now on the market for one. If you are seeking a gas-powered trimmer at the moment, we recommend that you look elsewhere.</p><p><br/></p><p>However, it is essential to take into account the advice made by our subject matter expert: not everyone needs a gasoline trimmer, and in most cases, a cheaper trimmer powered by batteries would be adequate. If, on the other hand, a gas unit is what you&#39;re after, we think investing in a Troy-Bilt TB25CB would be an excellent decision for you. This is because this particular model is known for its durability and reliability.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id=&#34;breql&#34;>How we tested Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer?</h2><p><br/></p><p>To put it another way, we could not think of everything the TB25CB was incapable of doing. We truly made an effort to do the very best we could. The grass had grown to an extremely long length, a dense layer of heath and bushes, and tendrils were spreading uncontrollably simply on the chain link fencing.</p><p><br/></p><p>The TB25CB&#39;s volume, which is a frequent source of criticism, is a drawback that you must avoid. That may sound like a terrible deal, but you have to pay that price for a reliable motor. While utilizing the TB25CB, we realized that either a headset with noise-canceling technology or premium earplugs were obligatory.</p><p><br/></p><p>Due to the fact that it requires gas in order to operate the device, the trimmer also emits some smoke. We were able to get a smell of the burning gas while we were working the trimmer, but as soon as we switched it off, the smell was gone entirely.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><h2 id=&#34;5fl2g&#34;>Is the Troy-Bilt TB25CB Trimmer Worth it?</h2><p><br/></p><p>That&#39;s what we&#39;ve come to believe, anyway. It&#39;s a cheap gas-powered machine that can masticate even the toughest weeds. If you&#39;re looking for a gas-powered trimmer, go no further than the TB25CB; it&#39;s a high-quality piece of machinery.</p><p><br/></p><p>It&#39;s in your best interest to listen to our expert advice: not everyone requires a gas trimmer, and in many circumstances, a cheaper, battery-operated Trimmer will do. But if you prefer gas power, we recommend the Troy-Bilt TB25CB.</p><p><br/></p><p>&#34;The Troybilt 25CB arrived on the weekend of our spring yard clean-up,&#34; gushed one satisfied customer. Our nearly one-acre yard is fully landscaped with curbs, walkways, paving stones, planting beds, trees, wooden and chain link fence lines, plants, and a cobbled patio. </p><p><br/></p><p>We found that the TB25CB gave the most consistent results with the least amount of work of any string trimmer we&#39;ve owned. It&#39;s uncomplicated to regulate the tempo and keep everything in balance. We used the TB25CB for about two hours without getting tired; it&#39;s a manageable trimmer to use, and after a fast refuelling, we were back to clearing out the winter&#39;s waste from our yard.</p><p><br/></p><p>Therefore, the TB25CB is the best Trimmer available.
