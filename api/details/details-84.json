Its password organizer lacks a desktop interface, emergency access, and password sharing. The iOS mobile security software is underwhelming, offering only essential email breach monitoring and a restricted VPN service in addition to browser protection. Additionally, the 200 MB daily data cap on the VPN included with most Bitdefender services is insufficient even for light online browsing.
