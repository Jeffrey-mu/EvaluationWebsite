It's far less complicated to operate than other portable projectors we've enjoyed in the past, thanks to the Android TV UI that comes preinstalled on it. Yet, you'll have to shell out a hefty sum to enjoy such a high level of functionality and convenience. You vividly recall the first digital projector I came across, a monochrome LCD that had to be attached to a conventional overhead projector like something of fancy transparency.</p><p><br></p><p>No, that... did not work out so well. And to be quite frank, for a very long time, utilizing digital projectors seemed like settling for a set of compromises: they were either too cumbersome, too dark, too hot, or too costly to maintain. Projectors have come a long way since their inception, and it's great that technology is now catching up with this concept.However, it's rather pricey and can't compete with larger projectors that don't need batteries, such as the BenQ HT2050A. You can obtain a better picture and save money, assuming you don't require cordless movie evenings with the Halo.</p>",

With its lightweight design and compact size, the Halo+ can be carried in a purse or backpack and moved about with ease. The gray projector's design is timeless and suitable for various settings. This projector packs a stylish punch and is easily a little bigger than some intelligent speakers. However, this is not all. A little clip upon that bottom may be raised to enhance the degree of elevation, and the projector has a few controls and a slot for connecting it to a stand or mount, so you have everything you need.</p>",

This would result in a neat, square design with a shiny metallic coating. Touch controls for playing and volume are located on the top, while the power button and other ports (HDMI, USB Type-A, 3.5mm headphone, and DC-in) may be found on the rear. Simi has a threaded connector for a tripod shoe and a little flip-out leg, mainly on the bottom so that the Halo+ may be pointed upward at an angle. In all, it's a nice bundle. However, I wish Xgimi had made a little more consideration for portability. Since the Halo+ has a small footprint of 4.46 x 5.70 inches, I naturally palm the top of it whenever I transport it; nevertheless, the device's weight of 3.5 pounds makes this a risky maneuver.</p><p><br></p><p>You'd also want to modify the projector's angle more freely than you can with the current setup (the flip-out leg at the base is very much an all-or-nothing deal), but the software keystoning is so unique it nearly doesn't matter. In contrast to the conventional Android TV remote, which is littered with permanent shortcut buttons to numerous streaming applications, Xgimi's remote is minimalistic and attractive. When I initially saw the diagonal volume rocker, I scoffed, but now I see how brilliant it is. I never have to glance at the device to adjust the level; the arrangement is that intuitive. You can easily change the keystone and the picture with a click of the settings button.</p><p><br></p><p>However, I would make a few tweaks, such as replacing the focus switch on the bottom edge of the remote with a standard button on the face. This method is functional but not intuitive. And, comparable to the Nvidia Shield remote, the remote has a triangular cross-section that, although comfortable in your palm, causes it to sway when used while sitting on a table. Simi says its brightness is between 700 and 900 ANSI lumens compared to the original Halo, putting it in the upper echelons of small portable projectors. That looks fantastic even with a bit of ambient light, and the projected picture holds its health.</p>",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671432559402.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Halo+ operates on Android 10, which works; it's not like other Android projectors that only conceal a little streaming stick. The silicon used here allows you to navigate the Android TV interface with incredible fluidity, and the whole experience is rather pleasant, with full access to that same Play Store and everything. That also means it starts up quickly and is ready to come out of hibernation within 6 seconds of pressing the power button on the remote. It takes approximately 40 seconds for the Halo+ to start up from a cold boot, which is noticeably longer but still not unacceptable.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to fill the screen with thumbnails from all of your preferred media organizations, you may need another ten or more. Xgimi's Halo+ is an impressive attempt to incorporate smartphone controls into Android TV hardware, which is not always easy. Attempting to change the display's orientation (the Halo+ can be assembled upside down or utilized with a rear projection screen) or activating auto-keystoning when the component detects that it has been moved are both possible through a specialized section in Android TV settings in addition to the usual keystoning and brightness adjustments.</p><p><br></p><p>Simi boasts a lot about the Halo+'s automated screen-adjusting capabilities, and they do a good job most of the time. Even though the auto-focus is quick, I wish the manual focus had finer adjusting. But the crowning achievement is the keystone system. You may adjust the projector's position about the screen in any of its four corners whenever in manual mode. This is more than simply a tilt function; it helps position the projector at such an angle. While this approach is adaptable, fine-tuning it might take time as you go from one control point to another. In most cases, the auto keystone is enough, and only perfectionists will want to make any more adjustments.</p><p><br></p><p>The brightness adjustments are convoluted and closely linked to the color balance. Even though there are a few default settings, I soon made a new profile with the sliders to the extreme. Using the Halo+ on batteries might sometimes be frustrating for me. Although a status symbol at the top provides a visual depiction of battery life, I would find it much more helpful to see the exact percentage left or, even better, a time estimate. In addition, if the battery life is too short, the device will automatically enter a strength mode that severely reduces the screen's brightness and adds a sickening yellow hue to the image. I like continuing my work in broad light to the very end.</p><p><br></p><p>I feel obligated to point out the absence of Netflix from this otherwise excellent software: it is not included. Although this eliminates the need for a useless Netflix button on that remote, Netflix will still refuse to play its broadcasts until you manually install the necessary certifications. Simi recommends officially connecting a Chromecast or other streaming stick to the projector's HDMI connection so that you may watch content from your device. This is not the time or place to criticize Reed Hastings's obsession with power. My advice is simple: enter the situation soberly.</p>",
