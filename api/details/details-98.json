  "description": "Amazon has finally refreshed its low-end Fire 7 tablet, adding brand-new hardware and software capabilities and raising the price to $59.99 ($10 more than before). These enhancements justify the little price hike but don't anticipate anything close to the quality of an iPad or another more recent Android slate.",

      "content": "<p>Amazon has not upgraded the Fire 7 tablet since 2019. This is an eternity in the world of technology. Then, in May, Amazon introduced a revised Fire 7 with improved battery life and performance, another front camera, a USB-C connector, and new placement. As a result of these upgrades, Amazon raised the price of the entry-level Fire 7 from $49.99 to $59.99. Amazon provided me with a review sample of the Fire 7 when it began delivering at the end of June. My primary uses for it have been light reading, light gaming, and light video consumption. And it succeeds admirably in that aspect. Amazon&#39;s smallest but least expensive tablet has been given a much-needed improvement in design, performance, <b>battery life</b>, and software, but at a higher price.</p><p><br/></p><p>It is hardly surprising that the 2022 version of the Fire 7 Tablet is less potent than other low-cost tablets in that market. The Fire 7 Tablet &#40;$59.99&#41; and the Fire HD 8 Tablet &#40;$89.99&#41; are great options if all you want to do is get started with Amazon&#39;s products and services while browsing the web on the go.</p><p><br/></p><p>Amazon hasn&#39;t upgraded the Fire 7 tablet since 2019, which is an eternity in the world of mobile devices. In May, Amazon released a revised Fire 7 with improved battery life and performance, some front camera, and USB Type-C connectivity.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Pros:</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>+        To put it simply: inexpensive.</p><p>+       Good power source.</p><p>+       Processor with improved speed over its ancestor.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Cons:</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>-        Poor efficiency.</p><p>-       Low-resolution cameras.</p><p>-       Inadequately sized and resolving screen.</p><p>-       Confined to the Amazon platform alone.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Specifications</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><b>Screen Size:  </b>7 inches</p><p><b>RAM:  </b>2GB</p><p><b>Internal Storage:  </b>16/32 GB</p><p><b>Bluetooth:  </b>5.0 LE</p><p><b>Weight &#40;g&#41;:</b>  282.00</p><p><b>Multi-touch:  </b>5-point</p><p><b>Abstracted LCD density:  </b>mdpi</p><p><b>Screen Resolution &#40;pixels&#41;:  </b>1280 x 800 IPS</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>The Technical Details, New Functions, And Moderate Improvement</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432688846.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The tablet&#39;s dimensions are the first thing that will jump out at you. It&#39;s not much larger than today&#39;s standard smartphone, measuring 7.11 centimeters in height and 4.63 inches in breadth. Also, the thick bezel means that even less of the already limited real estate is devoted to the display. The convenience of mobility comes at the expense of picture quality. The show is another problem. It has a less-than-HD resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels and isn&#39;t very bright, neither of which are deal breakers in the United Kingdom. That may seem like a litany of complaints, but there is good news on the broader picture. There has been a complete reworking of the Fire 7&#39;s hardware, yet the price has only increased by £10.</p><p><br/></p><p>The display and camera are both unchanged from the previous edition, and an audio connection is included, which is remarkable given the widespread elimination of such ports in modern consumer electronics. But most of the significant enhancements are internal. Amazon has significantly upgraded this tablet&#39;s RAM and processing capability. Compared to the 2019 model, Amazon claims it&#39;s 30 percent greater powerful. The new, improved battery from Amazon will allow you to use your device for longer each day. Aside from that, Amazon Alexa voice control has been included, which, although we didn&#39;t use it much, is likely to be attractive to most people, mainly when used in the home. Amazon has also upgraded to use USB-C charging cables. It&#39;s the kind of cable most homes have on hand. You will have to wait quite a bit to charge your device, maybe four hours fully.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Accelerated With Extended Battery Life</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432698722.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>It&#39;s up to 30% quicker than its predecessor, thanks to the tablet&#39;s upgraded CPU and more RAM. Although it&#39;s still not exceptionally fast, the user interface is quick to respond, and movies load quickly. Games performed well, although applications sometimes lagged. In addition to the basic model&#39;s 16 gigabytes of memory &#40;of which 9.5GB is usable&#41;, there&#39;s a microSD card slot for quickly expanding storage capacity.</p><p><br/></p><p>The battery life is excellent, lasting at least 10 hours of video playback. This is more than plenty for such a portable tablet, and it&#39;s also an increase of 3 hours over the tablet&#39;s immediate predecessor. However, it takes four hours to charge completely when using the 5W battery charger and only approximately 30 minutes quicker when using higher powerful chargers.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Sustainability</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432707033.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Although Amazon does not specify a battery&#39;s projected lifetime, it should survive at least 500 complete charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of its initial capacity. In addition to containing 35% recycled plastic, the Fire 7 is also typically repairable. The corporation shares details on its different eco-friendly initiatives, such as its trade-in and recycling programs.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Price</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Priced at £59.99 &#40;$59.99&#41; with advertisements on the lock screen and 16GB of storage, or £69.99 &#40;$79.99&#41; without 32GB of storage, the <b>Amazon Fire</b> 7 is available in two different memory capacities. There is a ten-pound &#40;$15&#41; fee to remove advertisements from the lock screen. Amazon also offers a special Fire 7 Kids Edition for £109.99, which includes a protective cover, a two-year replacement warranty, and a year&#39;s worth of the Kids+ subscription service, a video and app center designed with kids in mind. Amazon&#39;s Fire HD 8 goes for £89.99, while the Fire HD 10 goes for £149.99, but Apple&#39;s 10.2in iPad costs £319.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Design</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432719225.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Fire tablet&#39;s design is discrete and functional. On the front are a 7-inch screen and a webcam, while the back is made of soft plastic and has the Amazon logo in addition to a driver&#39;s side camera hidden in one of the corners. In addition to a lock button, temperature controls, and a 3.5mm headphone jack &#40;which not even the most costly iPads have&#41;, the sides of this tablet also have a USB-C charging connector, a mono speaker, and an SD card slot for adding more storage. It may be purchased in your choice of either black, rose, or denim &#40;blue&#41;.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The Fire 7 can&#39;t compete with productivity powerhouses like the iPad Pro or iPad Air, but it still has several features that tablets don&#39;t. The Fire 7 supports wired headphones through its 3.5mm jack and microSD cards, allowing for an additional 1TB of storage space. The software powering Amazon&#39;s streaming devices is based on an altered version of Android and has a design aesthetic similar to that of the Fire TV line. However, Google&#39;s Play services and the Play Store are absent. Instead, you have access to the Amazon Appstore, which has the essentials like Netflix, Spotify, and Disney Plus. On the other hand, there don&#39;t seem to be any app stores for Google or Apple.</p><p><br/></p><p>Consequently, you won&#39;t be able to access Apple TV, Apple Music, and YouTube &#40;though the latter may be accessed via a less-than-ideal workaround using a link to YouTube&#39;s website downloaded to your device&#39;s app library&#41;. Built right in is Alexa, Amazon&#39;s most helpful AI helper. Just ask to get it to do things like launch applications, check the forecast, or play a movie or TV program. This is the Alexa we&#39;re all familiar with, and she fits well with the rest of the program.</p><p><br/></p><p>However, the operating system might be slow due to the machine&#39;s relatively weak hardware. If you&#39;re patient, open to learning the game&#39;s somewhat odd layout, and able to put up with sometimes slow animations and loading times, it&#39;s playable. Both the front and back cameras are 2 megapixels. The front-facing camera is handy for video conversations, but the rear-facing camera is primarily unnecessary since there is no need to capture images with the Fire 7.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Making Use Of The Amazon Fire 7</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432729300.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Okay, so we know the standards, but how do they convert into an actual usable product? Though it has more processing power than its predecessor, the Amazon Fire 7 is nonetheless slow to respond. There is a noticeable delay while swiping across the home button, playing games, or browsing through articles. This is to be anticipated given the low cost of the gadget, and it won&#39;t deter many potential buyers because of it.</p><p><br/></p><p>You become accustomed to the little latency while swiping about the smartphone, and you forget about these problems altogether when streaming entertainment. The screen is something else you&#39;ll notice. It&#39;s difficult to see because of the dim lighting, as was described before. It was challenging to view the screen well when riding the train. Streamed media likewise suffers significantly from a lack of an HD monitor. The Fire 7 seems relatively durable, able to withstand a drop, some scratches, or even the not-so-careful hands of a toddler, irrespective of whether you&#39;re home or elsewhere in the world.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Embedded In An Ecosystem</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432738857.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>When you turn on a Fire 7, you&#39;ll see how well it works with Amazon immediately. Not surprisingly, given that Amazon created it, certain features will be unavailable to you if you are not already an Amazon Prime member. The Amazon services of Kindle and Audible, including Prime Video, take up a lot of space on the smartphone. When you first turn on the device, you&#39;ll see just three screens: a home page with your applications, a library page displaying your games and books, including Amazon Prime Video, and a Thank You page showcasing new books, Prime Video programs, and apps.</p><p><br/></p><p>While the Fire 7 is built on Android, it offers a different experience than expected. This eliminates several widely used services, including Instagram, Gmail, Twitter, Google Maps, Dailymotion, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Dropbox.</p><p>The close-knit environment may sometimes be limiting, but it has its benefits. This tablet may serve as a replacement for a Kindle thanks to the many Amazon applications that come preloaded. In addition, it is not any more cumbersome to carry about or heavier to handle than a standard Kindle. The Amazon Fire 7 may quickly fill in as a Kindle... with a little more oomph if you&#39;re currently in the market for a Kindle but enjoy the concept of a bit more capability, especially in gaming, streaming, and the odd surf of the internet.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Picture</b><b></b></h3><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671432746665.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>To start, it&#39;s important to note that the Fire 7&#39;s screen resolution is just HD. Numbers on something like a spec sheet don&#39;t often give you the complete picture, but this monitor has a resolution of 1024 x 600 and a pixel density of 171ppi. Although the Fire 7&#39;s <b>graphics</b> aren&#39;t ideal when playing the newest James Bond adventure, No Time to Die, they&#39;re surprisingly solid for a tablet of this price range. Although it isn&#39;t as bright compared to the more costly Fire HD 8, it makes up for this with impressive highlight shading as well as subtlety, as seen by the dazzling white snow surrounding the iced-over lake, which manages to preserve a surprising amount of information while avoiding a mass of overdone and featureless white.</p><p><br/></p><p>In comparison, the Fire 7&#39;s black depth and shadow detail aren&#39;t as good as those of the Fire HD 8, but they&#39;re still passable. The Fire 7&#39;s color reproduction is superior to the Fire HD 8, as seen by the more natural orange hue it gives to the candles in Bond&#39;s hotel room. The Fire HD 8 is a decent tablet, but it sometimes has somewhat oversaturated skin tones.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>Affordable tablet options include Amazon&#39;s Fire 7. Super inexpensive. Who has extra cash to drop on an iPad with the rising cost of living? It might be time to consider more affordable choices, and Amazon&#39;s entry-level tablet is ready to help smooth the transition. One must remember that &#34;cheap&#34; and &#34;excellent value&#34; differ. Robust and seamless performance can be had from any iPad, many Samsung tablets, and perhaps even devices like Xiaomi or Lenovo. One major drawback to all these options is their high price tags, which start at over £100 and rise to over £300 for most of them. Amazon has never made tablets to become the best in the market; instead, they&#39;ve focused on providing a good experience at the lowest feasible price. As a practical businessperson, I Can tell you that this is a vast untapped market.</p>",
