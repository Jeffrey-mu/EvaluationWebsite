They achieve this result using low-energy UV light with two distinct filters. The air in your area is drawn into the cleaners by an internal fan, where it is passed through an external filter and then into a deeper filter. The outside filter is responsible for collecting larger molecules, such as gas particles, mould, and dust.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside that deeper filter, the air is made to be exposed to UV radiation, which kills any potentially dangerous microbes that may be present. After then, the air escapes via vents at the very top of the apparatus. This method, in which Molekule's products are the only ones used, is termed photoelectrochemical oxidation, or PECO for short. Molekule is distinct from other air purifiers since it employs UV light to destroy particles. Most other air purifiers rely on HEPA filtration to capture and remove these particles from the air. Molekule uses UV light.</p><p><br></p><p>People are becoming more interested in mitigating this danger by using the usage of indoor air purifiers, such as the ones manufactured by Molekule. Molekule claims that its air purifiers can capture and destroy a wide variety of typical indoor air contaminants, ranging from gas-based paint fumes to bacterial spores. Molekule products have been praised by thousands of happy customers for improving the air quality in their homes, reducing allergens like dust and mould, and alleviating the symptoms of seasonal <b>allergies</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>However, Molekule air purifiers are not the least expensive on the market, and some people who are passionate about air purifiers claim that you may find a better deal elsewhere.
