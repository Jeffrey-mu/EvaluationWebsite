People with allergies are more likely to have respiratory problems when the allergens that trigger their allergies are in the air.

This type of filter benefits people who suffer from allergies because it removes 99.97 per cent of indoor air pollutants smaller than 0.3 microns.</p><p><br></p><p>As a point of reference, a particle of pollen may range in size from 10 to 200 microns, a piece of dust mite excrement can be anywhere from 10 to 40 microns, and the average size of a pet dander is between 5 and 10 microns. Keeping this in mind, an air purifier equipped with a HEPA filter can potentially remove almost all of the most common allergens from the air.</p><p><br></p><p>If that isn't the case, scroll down for our tried-and-true roundup of the best air purifiers for allergies.

They achieve this result using low-energy UV light with two distinct filters. The air in your area is drawn into the cleaners by an internal fan, where it is passed through an external filter and then into a deeper filter. The outside filter is responsible for collecting larger molecules, such as gas particles, mould, and dust.</p><p><br></p><p>Inside that deeper filter, the air is made to be exposed to UV radiation, which kills any potentially dangerous microbes that may be present. After then, the air escapes via vents at the very top of the apparatus. This method, in which Molekule's products are the only ones used, is termed photoelectrochemical oxidation, or PECO for short. Molekule is distinct from other air purifiers since it employs UV light to destroy particles. Most other air purifiers rely on HEPA filtration to capture and remove these particles from the air. Molekule uses UV light.</p><p><br></p><p>People are becoming more interested in mitigating this danger by using the usage of indoor air purifiers, such as the ones manufactured by Molekule. Molekule claims that its air purifiers can capture and destroy a wide variety of typical indoor air contaminants, ranging from gas-based paint fumes to bacterial spores. Molekule products have been praised by thousands of happy customers for improving the air quality in their homes, reducing allergens like dust and mould, and alleviating the symptoms of seasonal <b>allergies</b>.</p><p><br></p><p>However, Molekule air purifiers are not the least expensive on the market, and some people who are passionate about air purifiers claim that you may find a better deal elsewhere.
