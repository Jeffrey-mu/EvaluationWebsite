They come standard on most modern portable computers, and if you require a separate one, you can get one for relatively little money. However, they won't provide you with the high-quality video you have to succeed in live Streaming. <b>Logitech's StreamCam</b>, for only $169.99, has all the bells and whistles required for professional-quality live Streaming. It's a robust tool for streamers thanks to its capacity to shoot up to 1080p video with 60 frames per minute in panorama, landscape, and rectangular orientations, as well as its built-in screen and tripod mounts and competent software suite that allows you to edit your video feed effortlessly, and then you go live.</p><p><br></p><p>The Logitech StreamCams performance is excellent, about par with the Razer Kiyo Pro's. Still, it lacks a few convenience features, notably a USB-C port awkwardly plugged into the device's rear. It's not the most budget-friendly option if you're searching for a camera to participate in a few video conferences for business ($169/£139/AU$280).</p><p><br></p><p>Logitech StreamCam excels throughout every regard, from color fidelity through auto-exposure to focus quickness. It's 1080p and 60 fps. Blocks bind its legs. It's expensive, requires USB Type C, and has a 78-degree viewing experience.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+        Accurate and high-quality visuals plus.</p><p>+       An intuitive and straightforward camera app.</p><p>+       Plus, it runs at a silky-smooth 60 frames per second.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>-        The hardware has a significant impact on performance.</p><p>-       Restricting USB Type-C Port Use.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Specifications</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><b>Weight: </b>10.2 ounces</p><p><b>Cable Length: </b>5 feet</p><p><b>Focus type: </b>fixed</p><p><b>Lens type: </b>glass</p><p><b>Microphone:</b> Yes, stereo</p><p><b>Autofocus: </b>Yes</p><p><b>Privacy cover:</b> No</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Specifications and Construction</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433373253.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Compared to Logitech's other camera offerings, the StreamCam is notably unique. It has a more rectangular form and a bigger lens than its predecessor. Logitech replaced the standard flat plastic with decorative stitching, which thus matches the look of their MX Speakers but the Echo Show Dot. It has an attractive contemporary design but doesn't appear to fit well with today's gaming PCs. The black version works better, but this is just one of Logitech's strange design decisions. Logitech has improved not only the camera's aesthetics but also its functionality. The new f2.0 aperture is approximately a complete stop, more minor than the f2.8 of the C922.</p><p><br></p><p>It's true that perhaps the camera's sensor continues to be tiny to provide the same bokeh that a high-quality camera and lens would, but it doesn't make it useless. When the aperture is more significant, more light is let in, allowing for greater use in low-light conditions. The StreamCam may be configured in a variety of ways. The included mount lets you clip it onto the right side of the screen like a regular camera. However, it can also be unclipped and turned 90 degrees so you can record in portrait mode. It's an excellent addition that renders the StreamCam more flexible, but I can't help but question who it's meant for. Regarding social media apps like Facebook Stories, hardly anybody uses anything other than a smartphone, and most streamers don't even utilize vertical video.</p><p><br></p><p>The second attachment Logitech supplied was far more practical since it allowed the StreamCam to be attached to a tripod. The StreamCam requires a computer USB 3.0 connection in order to make use of its 60 fps @ 1080p resolution. Many folks accidentally connected their cameras to the wrong ports when the Brio first came out. The StreamCam's cord terminates at a USB Type-C port as a workaround. There is no such thing as an incorrect Type-C connection. However, some older computers may not even have a Type-C port. While Logitech suggests an adapter be used in this case, one is not included in the package despite the product's asking price of $169. Additionally, some streamers may not have cameras that support USB-C since it is not a standard feature.</p><p><br></p><p>The camera's integration with Logitech Capture enables several valuable extras, such as Active Noise cancellation and Auto Framing, unavailable on competing models. It's unclear how image stabilization works. The vast majority of cameras are permanently installed in one spot. There is no need for image stabilization with them. Activating it caused the video camera the zoom in, masking the blurry edges, but it didn't prevent the camera from moving about when I knocked on the desk. For me, the compromised viewing experience wasn't worth leaving on.</p><p><br></p><p>Auto framing is more intriguing, although it has a certain gimmicky air. In my experience, the StreamCam has the camera's most accurate face tracking. It works pretty well, and the frame followed me wherever I went inside the camera's 78-degree range of vision. However, it needs an additional sensitivity slider since the combination display pan, tilt, and zoom shifted too much as I leaned in my chair to be helpful rather than funny. However, I can understand the appeal if you're traveling along a stream from one location to another. The camera also doesn't support this functionality out of the box, so you'll need to have Logitech Capture running in the background when you use it alongside OBS or XSplit. Even though the application is relatively small, it may cause problems if your computer is already operating at peak performance.</p><p><br></p><p>The program's other features are in the early development stages at best. Frame rate is sacrificed for brightness in the recording mode but is preserved in the streaming mode. My picture was darker while using the Streaming preset than when I manually adjusted the brightness and contrast. Adjusting the brightness, contrast, and sharpness on the Image Settings tab is possible (and recommended for optimal results). However, the sliders are too tiny and don't change until you release the mouse. Many clicks are needed on what is a short slide. As soon as I figured out how anything worked, I switched back to ONE's native sliders since they were much more practical.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Performance</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433386178.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Video quality is the most crucial factor to consider when deciding whether or not to purchase a new camera, and the StreamCam must prove to be an upgrade over the market's current standard to win over consumers. Before purchasing your Elgato Cam Link last year, I would have the Razer Kiyo or Logitech Brio to compare it to. Featuring high-quality video recording and an integrated ring light, the Kiyo is very much like the C922. In this video, I review StreamCams software and then evaluate it against StreamCams competitors, the Brio and the Kiyo. There's also a sample from a capture-card-connected Sony RX100 Mark V there. You can see the improvement this costly solution provides over a standard webcam.</p><p><br></p><p>The Logitech StreamCams ability to focus on my face was its most vital feature. Once it locked upon me, it didn't care how far away I went but how bright those lights became. When I placed an item in its line of sight to make it concentrate, it made the switch very quickly, but it promptly reacquired me after I removed the distraction. The Razer Kiyo's results were comparable but somewhat slower. In contrast, the Brio fared poorly and struggled to distinguish me from the backdrop.</p><p><br></p><p>The StreamCam's capability in dim conditions also amazed me. The large aperture had a noticeable effect, which is excellent news for those who like streaming in low light. The camera captured far less grain than the Kiyo and improved its ability to resolve finer details in low light. The Brio's low-light performance was commendable, but the fact that it lost focus on my face rendered that advantage moot. Even after I switched off my Key Light, the <b>StreamCams frame</b> rate remained stable, and the video was as smooth as ever. The microphone was exceptionally high quality. However, I doubt many streamers would utilize it. The StreamCam has two microphones so that you may record in either stereo or dual mono. The microphones aren't exceptionally as high-quality as those found in a high-quality headset or a separate condenser mic. Still, they're enough to use with pals on Discord or make video calls.</p><p><br></p><p>Still, after three years of anticipation, I couldn't avoid but feel a bit let down. Like one would anticipate from a modern camera, the StreamCam improves upon its predecessor in terms of focusing and low-light capabilities. Even at 60 frames per second, however, is it the most incredible thing? It's not like that. What happened to all the cool new streaming features? If it meant getting a built-in ring light like the Razer Kiyo's or 4K at 30 fps, I would have been OK with the loss of Advanced Features and vertical video. All these are anticipated to fuel the growth of the StreamCam, a more desirable purchase than the C922 for its intended use. This sets a new standard regarding streaming cameras because although this may be sufficient, I wish Logitech had gone further in innovation.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Software</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The StreamCam is a <b>Logitech camera</b> compatible with Garmin Capture, which allows you to customize your videos with text, borders, filters, and effects. Aspect ratio, camera settings, audio, and other options are also customizable with Logitech Capture. The following image was captured using Logitech Capture's portrait mode. I entered the resolution in purple to show how text may be inserted. You'll find options for changing colors and wallpapers, among other things, in the menu on the left. This picture is in landscape orientation. The fixed 78-degree field of vision is the same in both landscape and portrait orientations. The camera was turned to get this shot, allowing more natural light to enter the camera. However, a shadow is visible in each of the three pictures.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Excellent Sound and Picture Quality</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433395939.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Regarding pricing, the StreamCam is among the most expensive cameras produced by Logitech. You have what you pay, and the excellent video quality in 1080p/60fps justifies the price. The hues are vivid and accurate. The color saturation and image quality are on par with the more expensive Logitech Brio but much above those of the more affordable Logitech C270 HD camera. The Logitech StreamCam was put through its paces on my Macbook Pro. The 1080p/60fps resolution ensures superb video quality. There are no abrupt transitions, and indeed the colors are rich and authentic to live. This is the ideal resolution for a camera if you plan on doing live broadcasting. The StreamCam can record in 1080p at 60 frames per second, as well as 720p, 360p, 24, 25, 30, 50, and 60 frames per second. The StreamCams intelligent auto-focus and exposure are made possible by facial-tracking technology powered by artificial intelligence. That's why the camera was able to follow my face as I made all kinds of expressions and expressionless faces.</p><p><br></p><p>When I flipped my laptop on its side, the auto exposure feature calibrated the webcam's brightness to the new orientation. While installed, the StreamCam may be effortlessly swiveled to switch between landscape and portrait orientations. Image stabilization is another convenient function since it prevents blurry photos even if the camera is dropped. The camera incorporates a dual bidirectional mic and maybe even a sound absorption filter for crystal-clear sound. Even though I didn't wander about the room much, the microphone picked up every time I adjusted my position in the chair or turned my head. To a lesser extent, it picked up on those motions too. The stream has a decent microphone setup with two mics, but if you're looking for the greatest possible sound, you should check out the microphones we recommend.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The high cost of the Logitech StreamCam prevents it from becoming the best camera on the market. It has excellent face tracking, decent performance in low light, and a silky 60 fps frame rate, making it one of the most excellent webcams I've used. Logitech Wireless Bluetooth Stream-cam was not the newest or the most powerful camera. Still, it originates from a reputable company that consistently produces high-quality hardware, making it a great value. It's inexpensive, lightweight, and sturdy, making it an excellent choice for when you're on the go, and you may quickly lose it or leave it in a bag. While it can still record in 1080p, camera streaming quality is capped at 720p. With Logitech optics and clever programming, it's likely to outperform a constructed Stream-cam on your PC.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"405","score":"4.5","subtitle":null,"amazon_adv":[{"id":405,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671524928915.jpeg","title":"Logitech Streamcam","original_price":"$169.99","actual_price":"$99.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3D6rT3m","description":""}]}]}
