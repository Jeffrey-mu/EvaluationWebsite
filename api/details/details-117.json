This product is a great value as it is lightweight &amp;'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' simple to use. But keep in mind that, for an electrical trimmer, it makes a lot of noise.</p><p><br></p><h2>Pros</h2><p>+ Powerful motor</p><p>+ Long Battery life</p><p><br></p><h2>Cons</h2><p>- Loud</p><p>- Plastic durability doubts</p><p><br></p><p>Once synonymous with high-quality hammers and ratchets, Craftsman has expanded its product line to include a wide variety of useful equipment. Craftsman is a tool, mower, blower, and trimmer brand's original owner was Sears, but Stanley Black Decker currently manufactures it. One of them is the Craftsman V20 Weedwhackers, and we believe it deserves a spot on our list of the best string trimmers.</p><p><br></p><p>When we first heard about the brand, we were dubious and wondered if it was getting in over its head. From manual to motorized to electric tools, including trimmers? Would they be able to pull it off successfully? It gives us great pleasure to report that the response is \"yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>Even though a battery powers it, the V20 trimmer is incredibly powerful despite its light weight and user-friendliness. The v20 can handle mowing down weeds as tall as your knees or smoothing the grass along a fence. The user only needs to press the trigger and then click the lithium-ion battery into place for the V20 to complete the rest of the setup. </p><p><br></p><p>The V20's setup is deceivingly straightforward out of the box. Even if it generates a level of noise that warrants the need for ear protection, the amount of power it exhibits makes it worthwhile to trim while wearing headphones. We have used this product in detail and got to try all kinds of settings. The performance and the design element, including the pricing of this product, are in further detail.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: Key Specs</h2><h2></h2><p><b>Type:</b> Electric</p><p><b>Battery:</b> Lithium-ion</p><p><b>Battery life:</b> 50 minutes </p><p><b>Dimensions:</b> 44\", 8.75\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 6.3 pounds</p><p><b>width of cutting:</b> 13\"</p><p><b>Warranty:</b> 3-years</p><p><br></p><p>When we first heard about the brand, we were dubious and wondered if it was getting in over its head.

The woodworker will get the work done; it may take a little extra time because you might need to go over thick material twice or slowly compared to using a weed gasoline string trimmer.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: Design</h2><p><br></p><p>The Craftsman V20 will not blow your mind when you first take it out of the box because it does not have any particularly noteworthy features. It is a lightweight unit that can be collapsed and extended, and it weighs just slightly more than six pounds. It is available in the two most common Craftsman colors, red and black. The exterior is composed primarily of plastic, so we won't deny that it has a slightly childlike appearance.</p><p><br></p><p>An additional feature of the Craftsman V20 is an inbuilt hook that is suitable for use with the Craftsman Versatrack organizing system. If you already own other Craftsman items, you may easily use this system to hang them in a basement or garage.</p><p><br></p><p>Having said that, after we had a hold of the grips, we recognized how pleasant the experience was. You can pull the trigger without much effort, and without an unexpected amount of strength, it hardly shakes. It's just a regular trimmer, but what sets it apart from others is its impressive power and the fact that it can edge.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437553435.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>When we pulled the trigger for the first time, we immediately realized that the V20 had been the full package. When you put it through its paces, the only thing it couldn't keep up with was the thick vines creeping along the ground.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: Performance</h2><p><br></p><p>This model did not live up to our expectations, which we have already said. Despite the fact that it looks like a toy right out of the box, the performance was much better than we had anticipated. As we held down on the trigger, It met us with a whir that was much louder than we had anticipated, as well as a rotating string that was able to eliminate a number of tenacious weeds we could discover.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only effective but also very easy to make use of in addition to its power. Even after a session of trimming that lasted for more than half an hour, there was no discernible shaking or vibration. The steadiness of the cuts exceeded expectations, and even when working through dense brambles, the V20 performed admirably in terms of its consistency.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437561690.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The V20 is designed specifically for do-it-yourself-yard management at home, which is why it is lightweight, simple to operate, and relatively straightforward to maintain. Although it lacks a shoulder strap, the string trimmer's lightweight (7 pounds) made it easy for our reviewers to have a firm grip while trimming grass. </p><p><br></p><p>Because there's only a single line to input, the V20 includes a button that it can use to feed the string, and when it comes time to change the string, it is quite easy to snap the lid off the spindle head. The spool head will ultimately wear out due to being dragged and scraped around the ground, but Craftsman has a reasonably priced replacement.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: Battery Life<b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Craftsman Weedwhacker, as was just said, includes an integrated hook that is suitable for use with the Versatrack storage and organization system—because of this, hanging the string trimmer in a basement or garage is an easy task that does not provide any safety concerns.</p><p><br></p><p>Every time the battery gets charged, it adds another 35 minutes to its total life, as shown by the results of our independent tests. If you call your place a \"yard\" instead of an \"asset,\" we're betting that you have time to spare before the gas company comes and trims the weeds around the meter and through the deck posts. This is not a lot of time in the business world, but if you call your place a \"yard\" instead of an \"asset,\" we're betting you have time to spare.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437609079.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>You can effectively reduce grass, weeds, and even raw bamboo shoots to debris that you can rake with the help of the V20. It has a great deal of ability to chew through dense short grass, but if the grasses are too dense and too high, it becomes entangled in them.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: price</h2><p><br></p><p>The Craftsman Weedwacker isn't a low-cost electric trimmer, coming in at close to $100; nonetheless, we believe that the price is reasonable, considering the power of the machine. </p><p><br></p><p>There are a number of battery-operated trimmers available in the market, with prices ranging from $40 to $75. Still, we are certain that the V20 outperforms each of these models in terms of functionality. Those interested in purchasing a V20 can do so at large-format retailers such as Lowe's &amp;'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Ace Hardware and on Amazon.com.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671437619092.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>We believe that the Weedwacker provides an outstanding value for the typical homeowner. It is more than capable of having to clean up after just a mower operation on smaller to medium-sized yards. Although it does not have the power or battery capacity for professionals, it is simple to maintain, gentle on the shoulders, and inexpensive.</p><p><br></p><h2>Craftsman V20: User Reviews</h2><p><br></p><p>Somewhere at the time of this article's writing, the Weedwacker had received a rating of 4.5 from out 5 stars on Amazon, with 69% of customer reviews awarding it the maximum possible number of ratings (five) and only 4% giving it the lowest possible rating (one). </p><p><br></p><p>People complimented the simplicity of use and portability of the strimmer in a number of user reviews; nevertheless, several customers complained about the length of time the battery lasted, alleging that it ran out of power after only 10 min of use. We would not suggest the V20 to a skilled landscaper because it is not the most efficient cutter on the market. </p><p><br></p><p>The battery performance is not very long, and it is easy to entangle it in tall, dense clumps of weeds. In addition, the guard is sufficiently large that it impedes the performance of various tasks that require attention to detail.</p><p><br></p><h2>Should you buy Craftsman V20?</h2><p><br></p><p>The answer to that question is affirmative from our end. Suppose you are looking for a dependable wireless trimmer that is successful against various plant life and can utilize in various settings. In that case, the Craftsman v20 will provide you with all you need to meet your expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an outstanding machine that, for a price that is less than one hundred dollars, appears to have the power to take on just about everything in a little to medium size job.</p><p><br></p><p>If you get a trimmer on the cheaper end of the price spectrum, you can save yourself fifty dollars; but the trimmer will not have the same power level, and its battery will not last as long as it would otherwise. You may realize that not spending a bit more money on higher performance and quality is a mistake in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>The V20 is a rock-solid solution for anyone on a budget, and let's face it: who isn't? Even while it won't be able to rid your backyard of its jungle-like appearance, this string trimmer makes short work of routine chores. It has a 7-pound weight and a 35-minute run time, making it easy for everyone in the family to pitch in on yard maintenance.</p><p><br></p><h2>How we tested Craftsman V20?</h2><h2></h2><p>We tested this product over the course of time, and here is what we have to say. The V20 is designed specifically for do-it-yourself-yard management at home, which is why it is lightweight, easy to transport, simple to operate, and relatively straightforward to maintain. Even though there is no shoulder harness attachment, our reviewers had no trouble holding onto this cord trimmer while it cut its way through the grass because it weighs only about 7 pounds.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there is just one path to feed, model V20 includes a button that you can use to feed the string, and when it comes time to change the string, it's fairly easy to snap the cover of the spindle head. The spindle head will ultimately wear out due to being dragged and scraped around the ground, but Craftsman has a reasonably priced replacement.</p><p><br></p><p>At a distance of one meter, we could measure 84 decibels with this equipment, which is objectively a low number compared to some of the other options, which tested in the lower 100-dB area. As a point of comparison, the sound level of 85 decibels is roughly equivalent to that of a subway train passing nearby or standing close to a diesel vehicle. When we switch it on for the first time, the string makes a rather loud thumping sound and has a pitch that is, in our opinion, somewhere between medium and high.</p><p><br></p><p>If you plan to use the V20 for further than just a few moments at a time, you should consider wearing ear protection; however, if you work on your lawn at a respectable hour, you won't disturb your neighbors.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"419","score":"4.5","amazon_adv":[{"id":419,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525568321.jpeg","title":"Craftsman V20 Weedwacker","original_price":"$119.00","actual_price":"$119.00","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3eCbg6b","description":""}]}]}
