Compared to the other video doorbells we evaluated, the Arlo Essential Doorbell Wired had the lowest number of false alarms and the ability to tell the difference between humans, animals, automobiles, and parcels with a paid subscription plan, so we&#39;d highly suggest it. The Eufy Security Video Doorbell 2K &#40;Rechargeable batteries&#41; is a simple solution with high-quality video and sound.
