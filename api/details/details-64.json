According to TaxSlayer, active-duty military members may submit a federal return for free \"in any tax scenarios - no limits.\" So, if you're a military member on a tight budget, TaxSlayer is your best bet. On the other hand, TaxSlayer does have certain limitations. For instance, if you want more in-depth assistance from TaxSlayer's gurus, you'll have to shell out some cash. Further, if your annual income is $100,000 or much more, TaxSlayer's Simply Free option will not be made accessible to you.
