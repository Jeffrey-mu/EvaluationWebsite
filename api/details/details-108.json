Excellent price considering how quickly it ships, how simple it is to assemble, and how well it does its advertised function.&#34; Another reviewer said, &#34;I&#39;m almost six feet tall, which made me apprehensive that perhaps the desk wouldn&#39;t want to go higher enough, but somehow it did.&#34;</p><p><br/></p><p>Customers who use the converter have reported a decrease in the number of back and posture-related ailments they encounter directly affecting their use of the converter.
