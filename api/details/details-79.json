Coupled with a high-quality display, you'll be astounded at how much you can accomplish while sitting at your desk. And yet, there is so much to think about that choosing might be difficult. Do you edit videos or play games? Then you should upgrade to a more robust graphics processing unit (GPU) system, like one from Alienware. More concerned with mundane activities like checking email and writing documents? Perhaps something more cost-effective would better suit your needs.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671428970262.jpeg","content_id":"977,228,445,446,447,448,1010","author_id":"8","release_time":"2022-10-21 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-19 13:50:51","update_time":"2023-01-04 14:33:40","entered_by":"admin","topping_state":"0","topping_title":"null","score":"","author_introduction":"A senior writer focused on selecting and writing articles around the best goods for household, finance, tech and health.","author_head_portrait":"/uploadsImg/1671161773831.jpeg","author_name":"Jennifer Garcia","category_recommend_list":[{"id":77,"article_id":"32","one_type":"18","two_type":"22","title":" Best cell phone providers: the top-rated providers and carriers","main_title":"Best Cell Phone Providers 2022: The Top-Rated Best Cell Phone Plans Providers and Carriers","keyword":" cutting-edge features, Mint Mobile, Visible ","description":"You should evaluate the cost of your current service to what it would be with a different plan or a different provider if you haven&#39;t already.

It's been reimagined with a sleeker, more upgradable chassis and the latest Intel 12th Generation \"Alder Lake\" hardware for enhanced performance since we last tested it. This tower's combinations are virtually limitless, scaling up to something like a liquid-cooled Core i9-12900K processor with Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card. At the same time, Dell's own Alienware Desktop offers more value for the money than the base model XPS. Among performing tower desktops that aren't built specifically for gaming or business, it takes home our Editor's Choice award.</p><p>The model I tested, which had an Intel Core i5-12600K computer, RTX 3060 Ti graphics, 16GB of RAM, and then a 512GB M.2 SSD, performed admirably across our usual suite of synthetic and real-world benchmarks and served as a reminder that small, playmaker desktop PCs deliver outstanding overall effectiveness. Single-core performance on Geek bench 5, a synthetic microprocessor benchmark, was 1595, and multi-core performance was 10353. The numbers aren't top-notch (they're slower than Apple's top MacBook Pro 16), but they're still quite respectable.</p><p>As of late, Dell has been in touch, offering to send along a review copy of their cutting-edge XPS 8950 desktop. At first, we had said, \"Dell countered our review with \"no, it was the 8940 Special Edition.\" After some time, we decided to stop producing a \"Special Edition\" and instead focus on improving the underlying technology. We upgraded it to a 12th generation processor and enlarged the case so that it could house more potent graphics cards while also improving cooling, ventilation, and accessibility.\" All right, Dell, go ahead and send it.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"363","score":"4.5","subtitle":"Best home computers","amazon_adv":[{"id":363,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671511249812.jpeg","title":" Dell ","original_price":" $1,259.99 ","actual_price":" $1,259.99 ","specifications":"XPS Desktop","link":"https://amzn.to/3dTP9HX","description":""}]},{"id":445,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>2.

Because many of us have spent the better part of the last two years cooped up at home, chatting on video with friends, family, and coworkers, these qualities seem especially welcome. While the M1 chip in the new iMac is certainly impressive, my time with the machine for my iMac 2021 review has left me more pleased with the high caliber of its screen, audio system, and camera.</p><p>The new iMac certainly doesn't disappoint in terms of speed. Apple's M1 chip, previously seen in the M1 MacBook Air, M1 MacBook Pro, and the Mac mini with M1, has now made its way into an iMac. Even while Apple hasn't transformed the iMac into a high-performance gaming machine, this 24-inch all-in-one is far more capable of handling any chores a family or student would throw at it, making it one of the greatest fully - featured computers and a part of the best computer systems period, you can buy right now. It's great that it took home gold in the all-in-one PC category at the Tom's Guide Awards 2021.</p><p>The new iMac 24 inches has been given a complete makeover and a fresh coat of paint. While the original iMacs were only available in silver aluminum, the new models come in seven colors that harken back to the iMac G3's vibrant glory.

Our as-tested configuration, which includes various enhancements, costs $1,089.99. To have such a sleek and modern desktop from Dell at such a reasonable price is impressive. Dell's display is minimalist, with narrow bezels and a fabric-covered chin that conceals the speakers. It's aesthetically pleasing, so it shouldn't be too stretchy to use in your home office. I appreciate how Dell incorporates a soft, white color scheme and fabric accents into their designs.</p><p>It still stands up after more scrutiny. The Dell Inspiron 27's chin rests on a cloth that's both soft and comfortable to the touch. If you turn it over, you'll see that it has a solid white matte plastic back panel with the Dell logo in shiny chrome. The legs, however, are made of sturdy metal and aren't plastic at all. The Inspiron 27 is compatible with modern wireless protocols like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. Inspiron 27 shoppers likely won't have installed a Wi-Fi 6E router or Bluetooth 5.2 wireless headphones (both relatively recent technologies). However, the PC is better prepared for the future thanks to these cutting-edge wireless functions.</p><p>Both high-quality and subpar dell desktop Inspiron options are available on the market. Some products are more effective than others, while some are plain bad. The issue is that it is difficult to differentiate quality products from subpar ones. The subject of which Dell desktop Inspiron is the best and why is one of the most frequently asked. We analyzed and evaluated numerous dell desktop Inspiron computers so that you wouldn't have to.

The list price of $3,500 reflects the high cost of all that muscle.

One of the most noticeable upgrades to this new model is the transparent window on the left side, which provides a glimpse of the device's inner workings. A pump and radiator all-in-one (AIO) water cooler, with the Alien head emblem as the radiator, cools the CPU. A little detail, to be sure, but there's something to be said for the openness that comes with advertising your gear in this way.</p><p>A unique feature that the Alienware Aurora R13 boasts over its predecessors is the introduction of PCIe 5.0 compatibility and DDR5 capability via Intel's Alder Lake Gen 12 processors. The review device we received was equipped with an RTX 3080, a speedy Intel Core i9-12900KF processor, and 64GB of SK-Hynix DDR5 RAM at 4400MHz.
