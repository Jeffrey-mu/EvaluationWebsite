They sell wares worldwide, including in North America, Central America, Europe, and Asia. Reading over several customer comments on Amazon about their items, I can say that they have a good reputation in cyberspace. That's a positive indication. I decided to buy the Samsonite Freeform luggage from their website to see how well they processed orders. The site was user-friendly, and placing an order for the goods was a pleasure. My order was acknowledged via email shortly after I submitted it, so I know it was successfully placed. I could monitor my bag's status from that point on. Their standard free shipping took around ten days to arrive after I made the order.</p><p>On the way towards our first trip with both bags, eight days after purchase, another of the spinners wheels broke off while rolling it around the airport parking area. Shifting course, the revolution \"dragged sideways\" for an instant, and the spinner detached itself from the axle. The wheel fell off the bag as it was being rolled perfectly typically. Since I could not *prove* that perhaps the revolution was not harmed due to improper usage, Samsonite will not repair it under warranty. The Freeform is, in general, a great travel bag. The material it's constructed from is strong yet relatively lightweight. The case's exterior is susceptible to scratches, which is the case's sole potential issue. A transparent cover, however, is a simple solution to this problem.</p><p><br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"380","score":"4.5","subtitle":"","amazon_adv":[{"id":380,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671518890192.jpeg","title":"Samsonite ","original_price":"$239.99 ","actual_price":" $158.66","specifications":"Freeform medium spinner","link":"https://amzn.to/3SJwXzz","description":""}]},{"id":479,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>4.
