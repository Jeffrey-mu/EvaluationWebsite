  "description": "A cheap bag performed better than bags spending hundreds of dollars more, including one that was ten times the price, according to recent testing by Social Media examiners of hardshell carry-on baggage. The best value is the Made By Design (Target's brand) hardshell luggage spinner bag. It is one of the four carry-on bags that Consumer Reports has deemed worthy of its Best Buy recommendation. Some variants have a center expansion mechanism, much to soft-sided baggage, to provide more room when necessary. ",

Hardshell luggage seems to be the newest fad, with popular brands like AWAY and ROAM catering to the young professional demographic. Hardshell (also recognized as hard-sided) baggage, often known as \"stateroom suitcases,\" were commonplace on transatlantic steamers in the mid-1800s. A Northwestern Airlines pilot designed the first damn rugged suitcase on wheels in the 1980s. There's a good reason why hardshell suitcases have become so popular even now; they're resistant to the elements and provide a lot more security than a duffel bag.</p>",

They sell wares worldwide, including in North America, Central America, Europe, and Asia. Reading over several customer comments on Amazon about their items, I can say that they have a good reputation in cyberspace. That's a positive indication. I decided to buy the Samsonite Freeform luggage from their website to see how well they processed orders. The site was user-friendly, and placing an order for the goods was a pleasure. My order was acknowledged via email shortly after I submitted it, so I know it was successfully placed. I could monitor my bag's status from that point on. Their standard free shipping took around ten days to arrive after I made the order.</p><p>On the way towards our first trip with both bags, eight days after purchase, another of the spinners wheels broke off while rolling it around the airport parking area. Shifting course, the revolution \"dragged sideways\" for an instant, and the spinner detached itself from the axle. The wheel fell off the bag as it was being rolled perfectly typically. Since I could not *prove* that perhaps the revolution was not harmed due to improper usage, Samsonite will not repair it under warranty. The Freeform is, in general, a great travel bag. The material it's constructed from is strong yet relatively lightweight. The case's exterior is susceptible to scratches, which is the case's sole potential issue. A transparent cover, however, is a simple solution to this problem.</p><p><br></p>",
