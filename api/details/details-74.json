The classic Livescribe 3 smart pen’s design and functionality are retained in this updated version, but the pen's aesthetic and tactile appeal has been much improved. Black now covers every silver accent, and thus the new model's matte plastic has a higher-end appearance and texture. Glass is used to stiffen the pen's plastic clip, making it far more difficult to break.

The Wacom Intuos Pro tablet is not a luxury but a necessity as I do a lot more Photoshop work. Year after year, new capabilities have been added to Wacom tablets, making them increasingly powerful and useful. Although the Intuos Pro is pricey, Wacom tablets haven't seen significant price increases over the years, making the latest models a better value. Please note that the Intuos 3 tablet that I used at home and for freelance work is now obsolete and that the Intuos Pro tablet that I use at work is an earlier model.</p><p>The Wacom Intuos Pro is the most recent model of the company's popular Intuos creative pen tablets. You can choose between a medium and a big, with the smaller size exclusive to the older model.

Since I don't want this to be a \"read later and discover out\" situation, I'll also state that these products are nearly identical. The particulars will be worked out as we go along.

The smart pen weighs 22 grams without the cap and measures a little about 6.25\" from tip to bottom. Despite its unusual triangular form, this pen writes as smoothly as any round one.
