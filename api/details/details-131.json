Its founders wanted to create a company that provided legal documents that could be produced and shared by everyone. The business quickly grew to include other areas, such as the supply of do-it-yourself legal services, such as the creation of wills. Rocket Lawyer claims that it has assisted around 20 million individuals in the United States, including the creation of 165,000 wills.</p><p><br/></p><p>Rocket Lawyer is a subscription service, which means they do not provide a one-time payment option to acquire their program. Rather, customers must pay a monthly fee.
