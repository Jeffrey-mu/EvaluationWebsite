Solar pool covers of over 800 square feet can easily cost over $200, whereas covers of 100 square feet or less can be purchased for $100 or less. Most pool covers allow you to trim them down to fit without voiding the guarantee if they are too big.</p><p><br></p><p>⮚ According to Gilda Dobrica, founder of ProSwim NYC and author of the Teach-Your-Child-To-Swim e-course, thicker pool coverings (14 to 16 mils) should provide superior insulation in colder, windier locations. Pool coverings with a thickness of 8 to 10 mils may be purchased for roughly $100 less and may be enough in warmer climes. Solar pool coverings in the 10–12 mm thick range are considered medium.</p><p><br></p><p>⮚ To get the most out of your solar pool cover, choose blue. Dobrica informed us that a pool liner with a UV-protected transparent blue tint provides an optimal balance between heat retention and chemical protection. According to Dobrica, a clear cover will let the greatest heat into the pool and let in more UV rays, which might reduce chlorine's disinfecting power.
