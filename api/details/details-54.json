The excitement might wilt out quickly if the grill isn't up to snuff. To help you maintain the good times (and the food), we've searched for gas grills that are resilient, simple to clean, and straightforward to use. Our study and experience with seven of the best grills on the market and many more led us to conclude that the Weber Spirit II E-310 is the best option for grilling meat and poultry. Its performance, convenience, longevity, and cost-effectiveness are unparalleled among grills.

The entire surface space for cooking is 320 square inches.</p><p>Reviews of barbecues tend to focus on elaborate models that do everything from the grill to roast to bake to smoke. When all you want to do is cook a burger, adding features like a rotisserie motor or WiFi connectivity may only add confusion and frustration.
