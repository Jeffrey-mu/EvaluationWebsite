In addition to providing you with coverage of a staggering one million dollars and support by telephone, this plan also throws in a copy of Norton's antivirus software at no additional cost. PrivacyGuard includes a multitude of other features, such as tools that make it simple for you to safeguard and manage your digital identity. Even while an identity theft protection service cannot prevent your data from leaking out, it may assist if it does.</p><p><br></p><p>If, despite your best attempts to maintain your privacy, your personal information is leaked by a large corporation, having PrivacyGuard on your side may be helpful. This means that you will be informed of the situation as quickly as possible and have a team ready to assist you in solving the difficulties so that your assets and identity will once again be protected.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+\tExcellent <b>credit</b> reports every month</p><p>+\tBest equipment</p><p>+\tFree antivirus software</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>- No technical assistance available around the clock</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Key Specs</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>· Tracking of your credit scores across all three bureaus</p><p>· Monitoring of credit daily</p><p>· Notifications by email and SMS</p><p>· Monthly status reports via email</p><p>· Text dedicated agents to resolve id fraud</p><p>· Secure browser and keyboard apps</p><p>· Financial calculator suite</p><p><br></p><p>Identity Protection, PrivacyGuard's standalone identity theft monitoring service, and <b>Total Protection</b>, a package that combines identity theft monitoring with the company's three-bureau credit monitoring, are both available to customers of PrivacyGuard. PrivacyGuard provides identity theft insurance of up to $1 million, support with online fraud, and access to a dedicated fraud resolution professional to assist you in regaining your identity, no matter which plans you choose. As part of the Credit Protection plan's financial protection offerings, you also have the option to focus on monitoring and protecting your credit score.</p><p><br></p><p>The identity protection services provided by PrivacyGuard monitor your personal information throughout the public and dark web and address changes made by the United States Postal Service. Additionally, it keeps an eye out for any unusual behavior involving your Social Security number, passport, bank accounts, driver's license, and credit and debit cards.</p><p><br></p><p>When your ID is utilized for an application or when your identity is discovered in public records, PrivacyGuard will notify you so that you can verify that it was indeed you. When you upgrade to the Total Protection plan, you get various additional services, including monitoring your children's Social Security numbers and credit reports.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Plans and Pricing</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The cost of using PrivacyGuard may be split into three tiers: identity, credit, and total. Web surveillance, wallet protection, and a specialized fraud ID resolution agent are all included in the most basic version of PrivacyGuard Identity, with a starting price of $9.99 per month. You will also get monitoring of your credit card accounts, driver's licenses, and bank accounts, among other benefits.</p><p><br></p><p>You can get credit scores and reports and monitoring 24/7 if the sign-up is for PrivacyGuard Credit for $19.99 per month to access. You'll receive messages via SMS and email, the PrivacyGuard application that is the dedicated ID security agent for fraud, an encrypted internet browser and keyboard, a credit score simulator, a helpline for credit information, and an application for financial calculators. Furthermore, you'll get access to an exclusive ID Fraud resolution specialist.</p><p><br></p><p>If upgrading to the PrivacyGuard Total package, which is $24.99 each month and featured in the review below, you will get all these options and other features for the same price. Apart from monitoring your social security number as well as driver's licenses and passports as well as bank accounts, debit and credit card, USPS address changes, email telephone, DOB, ID applications, names, public records, the social security number of children's dark web, and public scanning are the primary extras. In addition, you can get neighborhood reports, medical reimbursement documents, a one-million-dollar security policy for theft, protection from stolen and lost wallets, and many more.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>PrivacyGuard is constantly monitoring the internet and the dark web for any behavior that might indicate that your personal information has been stolen and is being offered for sale. In addition to this, it examines documents about real estate and the judicial system and incorporates information about your appearance, or lack thereof, in your monthly reports.</p><p><br></p><p>Including several credit and financial calculators and simulators that make it possible for you to optimize the effectiveness of your money management is a very beneficial feature. We found the scenario simulator that collaborates with the three credit bureaus extremely helpful. This feature is perfect if you are considering making a significant purchase, such as purchasing a vehicle.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no two-factor authentication option available to keep your account safe. This is something that should be mentioned. Although disappointing, this is not a deal killer by any means. In addition, there is not enough emphasis placed on families, which makes us appreciate the child protection services that IdentityForce, such as Childwatch.</p><p><br></p><p>If the worst case scenario occurs and your identity is stolen and used by someone else, having a personal case worker who can assist you in making a claim for up to $1 million with attorneys, court filings, obtaining fresh documents, and carrying out investigations is a significant benefit. The corporation guarantees that it will make up for lost money at a rate of up to $1,500 per week for a maximum of five weeks to cover things like salary and travel expenses.</p><p><br></p><p>Notifications are useful and may arrive via email, SMS, or the app. This scans a lot of information and notifies you of everything from public record mentions and credit modifications to variations in your address. If everything goes according to plan, all you'll have to do is check your email each month for an \"All Clear\" signal. You will also be notified with a map of your new location if a registered sexual offender moves close to you. This is a very helpful tool. You may also get assistance from the personnel to put a freeze on your credit, but it is not as simple as clicking a button as it is with services like Norton LifeLock.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Insurance and Services</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>If someone steals your identity, PrivacyGuard will provide you with a specialized case worker and up to one million dollars to assist pay for legal representation, court filings, the acquisition of new documents, and investigations.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no lost-wallet protection in and of itself, but the Lost &amp;'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Stolen Assistance service offered by PrivacyGuard is a fair substitute. It can help you cancel lost or stolen credit cards and get new ones issued. If you find yourself stranded far from home, it can offer you $1,000 in cash for emergencies and a one-way airline ticket.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671503269711.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Interface and Utilities</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The online interface of PrivacyGuard crams a significant amount of credit information into a very small area. The website generally had a slow feel to it, with pages taking ten to fifteen seconds to load. The primary page displayed a tabulation of warnings to the right of my three agency scores, shown at the top. There were locations where one could order their credit reports and see how their credit scores had changed over time.</p><p><br></p><p>I was taken on a journey down memory lane when I noticed the three most recent locations I'd lived in, dating back to the 1980s. Unfortunately, the Experian report said that I was still working at a magazine that had ceased operations many years ago, and the Equifax record stated that I did not have any job history; nonetheless, neither of these inconsistencies could be attributed to PrivacyGuard's actions.</p><p><br></p><p>The one-of-a-kind 24/7 Identity Monitoring Station that the service provides reveals the types of personally identifiable information for which the service searches the internet. Next to each category of information are red, yellow, and green indicators that show what you've already filled in, what you need to fill in, and what you've already supplied. Do you need assistance in adding a new account or phone number? When you touch or click on that region, it will open.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>How Simple Is The Operation Of Privacyguard Total Protection?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>One of the services that may be set up with the least amount of effort is PrivacyGuard Total. It may take as little as four minutes to go from having nothing to being fully operational. After you have completed a credit history exam that is a red herring, you will be given your login ID and your VantageScore 3.0 credit ratings. You may use applications on both iOS and Android that come with a secure keyboard and a secured browser to help keep you more secure. These apps are available to use on both mobile operating systems. Telephone technical help is accessible to you if you run into any problems; however, this support is not available around the clock.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there is so much information packed into such a small area, navigating the website may be a bit of a chore at times; however, the three credit agency ratings are shown prominently and plainly in the front and center of the page, which is a great touch. PrivacyGuard provides a quite unique service in the form of an identity monitoring station available around the clock. This station performs scans online and indicates, with the help of color-coded symbols, what information you have supplied and what information is still missing.</p><p><br></p><p>Credit score monitoring is quite good, and customers regularly get a consolidated credit report. In contrast to most services, we do not provide quarterly or yearly reports. This even includes a countdown clock that displays the time remaining before the next report is ready. What's the catch? You are only allowed ten different bank accounts and credit cards together. Therefore, there is not much of a catch at all.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Is It Recommended That You Go With Privacyguard Total Protection?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>PrivacyGuard is an extremely thorough service that provides individual support, which might prove to be of great use in the event that your identity is stolen. However, this goes beyond what many businesses provide because of the wide variety of available credit monitoring alerts and financial simulators. It is neither the most affordable, like ID Watchdog nor the most reliable, like IdentityForce UltraSecure+Credit. Instead, it falls somewhere in the middle. However, this is an extremely alluring alternative with several tools that are hard to get and quite effective.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671503290364.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><h2><b>How PrivacyGuard Compares to Other Options</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>It is essential to compare many of the industry's leading service providers if you want to get the most effective identity theft protection that money can buy. Identifying the aspects that set the other businesses apart is not difficult. For instance, ID Watchdog enables customers to buy family policies that, for an additional fee, also protect their children. You may also purchase protection for your children if you are a member of LifeLock; however, you will be required to pay a separate price for each of your children.</p><p><br></p><p>Be aware that the vast majority of other service providers include tracking at least one of your credit reports as part of all of their plans; however, PrivacyGuard does not provide this service with any of their plans other than Credit Protection and Total Protection. PrivacyGuard, in contrast to the majority of the industry's leading providers of identity theft protection services, does not include identity theft insurance in any of its service plans.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","amazon_adv":[]}]}
