This is true regardless of the viewer's connection to the person who died away. A living trust, on the other hand, is a document that is enforceable under the law and that explains how a person wishes part or all of their assets to be distributed after they pass away. A living trust does not have to be submitted to a court as a will does; thus, the information contained inside it may be kept private.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671503846920.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Should You Go With Law Depot?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The will preparation service provided by Law Depot is very cost-effective.
