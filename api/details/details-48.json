The ability of the robot to avoid pet feces is the key benefit of this function. iRobot is so sure that the Roomba j7+ is smart that they are replacing any j7+ that can't detect and avoid solid pet waste under the Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P.).

Even though we've seen higher marks for pet hair, an 82.5 percent accuracy rate is rather good.
