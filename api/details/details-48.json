Thanks to this, it can avoid obstacles like wires and socks that it may otherwise run into. The ability of the robot to avoid pet feces is the key benefit of this function. iRobot is so sure that the Roomba j7+ is smart that they are replacing any j7+ that can't detect and avoid solid pet waste under the Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P.).

The detritus it can keep is 60 days, more compact, and aesthetically pleasing compared to other bases. Scores of 98.33 and 94.6% for collecting cereal and kitty litter indicate that this robot vacuum does a good job with these major material types. Even though we've seen higher marks for pet hair, an 82.5 percent accuracy rate is rather good.
