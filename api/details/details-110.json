That's a lot of protection against water, so you can even use it in the shower if that's your thing. You should use the magnetic wall mount provided by Oclean to store the toothbrush at all times. It's a brilliant invention that prevents the toothbrush from touching the moist bathroom counter or sink and allows you to position the toothbrush exactly where you require it at a comfortable working height.

A USB cable is permanently attached to the base. Roughly 80 centimeters of cable is included. To charge the brush, simply plug it into a USB connection on a computer, laptop, or wall outlet. The USB port makes it convenient to bring the stand along wherever you go. There is no need to worry about finding an adaptor or changing voltages.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no USB plug adaptor included. However, if you've got one that plugs into a wall, you can use it.

This toothbrush is one of our favorites. The noise level of this electric toothbrush is the lowest I've ever experienced with one.

They are not always as obvious as one may think. The app does not include all of the functionality that you might anticipate finding in it. It is possible to enhance the software. Just don't buy it with the expectation that it will turn out to be true. When you think about everything it offers, you'll realize that you might get a lot worse for the price.</p><p><br></p><p>Well-designed though it may be, I wish two brush heads had been supplied with my Oclean’s X Pro the Elite toothbrush.

If you intend to dig into the nitty-gritty of it, though, the app's complexity may turn off some potential users. It's possible that Oclean will have a revolutionary app on its hands if they only improve it and make it easier to use.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"HOW WE TESTED THE OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH?","amazon_adv":[]}]}
