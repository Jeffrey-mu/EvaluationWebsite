In addition to the brush, you&#39;ll receive one replacement head for that price. It&#39;s also worth looking at the bundles that include a sterilizing unit and extra heads for the same low price.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Oclean’s X Pro Elite is an excellent electric toothbrush that excels in all areas and comes equipped with advanced features that make it simple to personalize your brushing routine and identify problem areas that may require further attention.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: KEY SPECS</h2><p><br/></p><p><b>RPM:</b> 42,000 RPM</p><p><b>Screen</b>: Touchscreen colored</p><p><b>Battery Life:</b> 35 battery days</p><p><b>Charging</b>: Wireless fast charging</p><p><b>Rack</b>: Wall-mounted rack</p><p><b>Modes:</b> Four modes</p><p><b>Brush Settings</b>: 30-plus brush settings</p><p><b>Alerts</b>: 30s alerts</p><p><b>Timer</b>: Two-minute timer</p><p><br/></p><p>Oclean’s X Pro Elite is a great sonic toothbrush that comes at a very low price and features a slim and stylish design and great battery life. On the other hand, the software is not quite as remarkable as the hardware, and the smart functions of the brush aren&#39;t always reliable.</p><p><br/></p><p>There are a few different versions of the Oclean electric toothbrush available. Although it is on the costlier side of the spectrum, this X Pro Elite that we are evaluating nevertheless provides an outstanding value when considering all of its features.</p><p><br/></p><p>Xiaomi is primarily recognized as a smartphone manufacturer, but it also has a lesser-known sub-brand called Oclean. But in addition to that, it manufactures a variety of other high-tech health and cosmetic items, such as digital scales.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Oclean app may be downloaded for free on both iOS and Android by creating an account and then accessing the app through the link sent to your inbox. The handbook doesn&#39;t say this, but we had to leave the toothbrush in its charging dock throughout the pairing process, or it would turn off prematurely. Afterward, Bluetooth stopped giving us any trouble.</p><p><br/></p><p>After you&#39;ve paired your brush, you&#39;ll be sent to an app that looks great at first glance but is actually quite complicated and full of functions you&#39;ll never use.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: DESIGN</h2><p><br/></p><p>It comes in a package of magnetic wall mount, a user handbook, a wireless USB charger, and a single brush handle and head. A carrying case is not included but can be purchased separately. The 16-centimeter toothbrush has a limestone grey color and a matte finish for better handling. Its 2cm diameter makes it more manageable and more portable than competing brushes.</p><p><br/></p><p>With an IPX7 rating, it can withstand being submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at a time. That&#39;s a lot of protection against water, so you can even use it in the shower if that&#39;s your thing. You should use the magnetic wall mount provided by Oclean to store the toothbrush at all times. It&#39;s a brilliant invention that prevents the toothbrush from touching the moist bathroom counter or sink and allows you to position the toothbrush exactly where you require it at a comfortable working height. This option is more orderly and neater.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671434447978.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Whether you suffer from sensitive teeth or just want a thorough cleaning, one of the four brushing modes will work for you thanks to its 32 adjustable degrees of intensity. Two minutes is the default period for brushing, but you may change the mode, length, and intensity on the brush&#39;s touchscreen if you like to take your time. The Oclean app includes a quiz to help you determine the optimal brushing parameters. Ours was set on white mode, strength 4, and a three-minute brushing time.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: PERFORMANCE</h2><p><br/></p><p>The Oclean Sonic Toothbrush rotates at up to 42,000 revolutions per minute, making it a sonic toothbrush. Sonic toothbrushes employ high-frequency sound waves to loosen and remove plaque from tooth surfaces. This is far faster than the oscillating speed of the typical electric toothbrush, which ranges from 1,300 to 8,800 rpm.</p><p><br/></p><p>The toothbrush may be turned on and off using the single button on the front, which also serves as a menu selector. You can access the menu by swiping down on the touchscreen; it has settings for the brushing time &#40;2, 2.5, or 3 minutes&#41;, the brushing intensity &#40;low, medium, high&#41;, and the four brushing modes &#40;clean, sensitive, massage, and white&#41;.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671434517471.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>According to Oclean, the brush features 32 different brushing settings, which we can select from among its many modes and intensities &#40;which vary from an extremely delicate vibration to a more forceful one&#41;. If you&#39;re having trouble finding the right person, take the app&#39;s profile quiz. In normal use, however, you need only touch the button first to turn it on and one more to get the brush moving.</p><p><br/></p><p>The brush handle has a variety of modes and intensities that are completely adequate for most people. Still, the app makes things more confusing by offering individual &#34;plans&#34; for various oral care routines. Choose from 12 convenient cleaning modes, such as &#34;standard,&#34; &#34;gentle,&#34; &#34;newbie,&#34; and &#34;braces,&#34; to name just a few.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: BATTERY LIFE</h2><p><br/></p><p>The lengthy battery life of the brush makes it practical to store it in its mount rather than on a charger because of its portability. Since the wireless base will only need to be charged once per month, you may store it in a cabinet until it is required again, which will help reduce the amount of clutter in the bathroom. </p><p>In addition, because it is charged by USB, you do not need a power socket designed specifically for shavers or an adapter designed specifically for shavers&#39; plugs; instead, you may use the same converter you employ for your smartphone or laptop.</p><p><br/></p><p>The 88mAH battery is stored in the brush handle, and it takes around three and a half hours to charge fully. After 26 days of twice-daily 2-minute uses, the toothbrush had a 27% charge. This means that the toothbrush loses between 1% and 2% of its charge capacity with each 2-minute use.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671434543625.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>Although we didn&#39;t get the chance to put it to the test, Oclean claims that You can charge your toothbrush through a variety of different wireless methods. A USB cable is permanently attached to the base. Roughly 80 centimeters of cable is included. To charge the brush, simply plug it into a USB connection on a computer, laptop, or wall outlet. The USB port makes it convenient to bring the stand along wherever you go. There is no need to worry about finding an adaptor or changing voltages.</p><p>There is no USB plug adaptor included. However, if you&#39;ve got one that plugs into a wall, you can use it. The USB cord, the cover, and the stand are all white. The Elite&#39;s screen will illuminate while charging to indicate its progress. The smartphone app also displays the precise battery percentage.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN’s X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: PRICE</h2><p><br/></p><p>You can purchase this toothbrush in the United States and around the world. The US price of $79.99 is a steal considering all of its useful functions. Amazon sells it right now in the UK. However, the price fluctuates wildly between £80 and £118, so timing your purchase is essential.</p><p><br/></p><p>Suppose you&#39;re interested in the Oclean because of its ergonomic design and long battery life but aren&#39;t committed to this specific model. In that case, you can check out other available models on Amazon in the UK or the Oclean website in the US.</p><p><br/></p><p><img src=&#34;http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1671434597162.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p>At the time of publication, replacement brush heads cost approximately $5 through Oclean in the United States or £6.50 through Amazon in the UK. However, if you delay a sale, you won&#39;t save as much money as you would if you bought new heads from a major brand like Oral-B, for which you can find suitable substitute heads for under a pound.</p><p><br/></p><h2>OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH: USER REVIEWS</h2><p><br/></p><p>Customers have very positive opinions about this product, giving it an average rating of 4 stars on Amazon. People in especially like how long the battery life lasts and how their teeth feel after using it: smooth and clean. </p><p><br/></p><p>The usefulness of the toothbrush holder that is installed on the wall is complimented multiple times, and one customer compliments the toothbrush holder for being lightweight and simple to use. Some of the reviews that aren&#39;t as positive point out that the vibrating action of the brush isn&#39;t as powerful or intense as other brands on the market.</p><p><br/></p><h2>SHOULD YOU BUY OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH?</h2><p><br/></p><p>If you are into analysis and the finer points of your teeth-cleaning routine, you will adore this toothbrush which we highly suggest. The family mode is particularly helpful for parents who wish to keep a close eye on their children&#39;s oral health or who want reminders about when to replace the toothbrush head for other family members.</p><p>Consider purchasing an Oclean’s Sonic Toothbrush if you are looking for a sonic toothbrush that has a cleaning power of 42,000rpm, a battery that can last for over a month after a single full charge, is silent, comfortable to use, and has a significant reach.</p><p><br/></p><p>The extended life of its battery and the speed with which you may charge it through USB are its defining characteristics. There is no requirement to install charging stations in your lavatory, nor is there any danger of you being caught off guard on a journey with a flat battery. At this pricing point, we believe that the advanced features are a worthwhile add-on, particularly the customized programming options.</p><p><br/></p><h2>HOW WE TESTED THE OCLEAN X PRO ELITE SMART TOOTHBRUSH?</h2><p><br/></p><p>We have tested this Oclean’s toothbrush, which delivers a powerful performance. This toothbrush is one of our favorites. The noise level of this electric toothbrush is the lowest I&#39;ve ever experienced with one. It boasts a color touchscreen that is intuitive, functional, and incorporated right into the handle. It does a good job of cleaning the teeth. In spite of the fact that it has 32 distinct intensity settings, it is not quite as powerful as the Oral-B.</p><p><br/></p><p>You should consider this sonic electric toothbrush for your purchase if you are seeking for one that is reasonably priced and offers a nice experience overall. It has some flaws, but nothing is perfect, right?</p><p><br/></p><p>The Bluetooth connectivity and the mobile app for smartphones give the impression of being an afterthought. They are not always as obvious as one may think. The app does not include all of the functionality that you might anticipate finding in it. It is possible to enhance the software. Just don&#39;t buy it with the expectation that it will turn out to be true. When you think about everything it offers, you&#39;ll realize that you might get a lot worse for the price.</p><p><br/></p><p>Well-designed though it may be, I wish two brush heads had been supplied with my Oclean’s X Pro the Elite toothbrush. It seems to me that you&#39;d have to be a dental hygienist to get the most out of this app.</p><p><br/></p><p>But if you only desire to use the brush, I think you&#39;ll find it handy even without the app, thanks to the features accessible through the brush&#39;s touchscreen that place it among the market&#39;s most premium unconventional options. If you intend to dig into the nitty-gritty of it, though, the app&#39;s complexity may turn off some potential users. It&#39;s possible that Oclean will have a revolutionary app on its hands if they only improve it and make it easier to use.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"412","score":"5","amazon_adv":[{"id":412,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525247430.jpeg","title":"Oclean X Pro Elite Smart Toothbrush","original_price":"$99.99","actual_price":"$99.99","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3MElNKt","description":""}]}]}
