That's a lot of protection against water, so you can even use it in the shower if that's your thing. You should use the magnetic wall mount provided by Oclean to store the toothbrush at all times. It's a brilliant invention that prevents the toothbrush from touching the moist bathroom counter or sink and allows you to position the toothbrush exactly where you require it at a comfortable working height.

Sonic toothbrushes employ high-frequency sound waves to loosen and remove plaque from tooth surfaces. This is far faster than the oscillating speed of the typical electric toothbrush, which ranges from 1,300 to 8,800 rpm.</span></p><p><br></p><p>The toothbrush may be turned on and off using the single button on the front, which also serves as a menu selector. You can access the menu by swiping down on the touchscreen; it has settings for the brushing time (2, 2.5, or 3 minutes), the brushing intensity (low, medium, high), and the four brushing modes (clean, sensitive, massage, and white).</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671434517471.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>According to Oclean, the brush features 32 different brushing settings, which we can select from among its many modes and intensities (which vary from an extremely delicate vibration to a more forceful one).

After 26 days of twice-daily 2-minute uses, the toothbrush had a 27% charge.

A USB cable is permanently attached to the base. Roughly 80 centimeters of cable is included. To charge the brush, simply plug it into a USB connection on a computer, laptop, or wall outlet. The USB port makes it convenient to bring the stand along wherever you go. There is no need to worry about finding an adaptor or changing voltages.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no USB plug adaptor included. However, if you've got one that plugs into a wall, you can use it.

This toothbrush is one of our favorites. The noise level of this electric toothbrush is the lowest I've ever experienced with one.

They are not always as obvious as one may think. The app does not include all of the functionality that you might anticipate finding in it. It is possible to enhance the software. Just don't buy it with the expectation that it will turn out to be true. When you think about everything it offers, you'll realize that you might get a lot worse for the price.</p><p><br></p><p>Well-designed though it may be, I wish two brush heads had been supplied with my Oclean’s X Pro the Elite toothbrush.
