Qustodio is equipped with virtually every function that might be desired by a worried parent, such as web content filtering, powerful app banning, and a comprehensive activity record. You can handle all settings and monitoring through either the web dashboard of Qustodio or the parental feature of its mobile applications.

The good news is that Net Nanny has evolved from its original purpose as an internet filter to include features that restrict a child's access to specific applications and limit their screen time. These features are fully functional, and the web filter is significantly less susceptible to bypasses than in our previous reviews. However, it now provides only rudimentary geofencing options. In addition, rivals offer a better value overall by covering a more significant number of devices in their plans.</p><p>The standard set of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, as well as Amazon's Fire OS (Kindle), are all supported by Net Nanny. Please be aware that Net Nanny has two mobile apps available. You'll need to use the first one to set up parental controls and monitor your child's device. Net Nanny is a web-based interface where you can modify settings. Qustodio and Safe Kids match their platform support. In contrast to Norton Family Premier, which can assist parents whose children use macOS laptops, Mobicip goes further by supporting Chromebooks.</p><p>Regarding app management systems, Net Nanny is among the best we've seen. This program is among the few that can monitor a child's device and notify parents whenever their youngster installs a new app. To help you make an informed decision, Net Nanny provides a summary of the app and links to its App Advisor page, where you can read more about the app's advantages and disadvantages.</p><p><br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"613","score":"","subtitle":"null","amazon_adv":[{"id":613,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1672195669626.jpeg","title":"Net Nanny","original_price":null,"actual_price":null,"specifications":null,"link":"https://www.netnanny.com/","description":null}]},{"id":462,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2>3.
