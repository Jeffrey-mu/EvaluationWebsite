      "content": "<p>These programs have several names, like Internet Filtering Software, Web Filter, and Web Filtering Software, just a few examples. These terms refer to programs used to manage material on the web. The term &#34;Internet Filtering Software&#34; describes what it does: it keeps track of which websites users are trying to access and then restricts them.</p><p>Almost thirty years ago, in the United States, the CIPA &#40;Children&#39;s Internet Protection Act&#41; mandated that all public library computers in the country be equipped with software to restrict access to inappropriate websites and materials. These approaches have remained popular throughout the past thirty years.</p><p>On the contrary, Internet Filtering Software has made its way into public administrations, private businesses, and even households since it was first implemented in schools and universities. Many requirements can be met by navigation-blocking software. We have gathered the best software to filter your internet, including Qustodio and Net Nanny.</p><p>Some American colleges and universities have implemented such measures to restrict access to pornographic content while allowing students to utilize the campus-wide Wi-Fi network. At the turn of the millennium, for a few years, traffic destined for the Napster server constituted more than 50% of all web traffic from educational institutions.</p><p>Home connections were too slow to allow for the immediate download of even a single album in MP3 format. Because of the pay-per-use nature of the service, getting the download set up usually included a significant financial outlay and the interruption of the home network for several hours. So, students clogged up the internet by downloading audio content from university computers.</p><p><br/></p><h2>1. Qustodio</h2><p><img src=&#34;/uploadsImg/1671429767091.png&#34; style=&#34;max-width:100%;&#34; contenteditable=&#34;false&#34;/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Qustodio</b></p><p>The best touchscreen monitor, featuring smooth touch and interactive display.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></p><p>+ 1-15 gadgets</p><p>+ Android, iOS, Kindle, Windows, Mac, Chrome OS</p><p>+ Parental website: yes</p><p>+ Android-only call logging</p><p><br/></p><p><b>REASONS TO BUY</b></p><p>+ User-friendly website</p><p>+ Time limits</p><p>+ Desktop/mobile app blocking</p><p>+ Multiplatform</p><p>+ Smart apps</p><p><br/></p><p><b>REASONS TO AVOID</b></p><p>- Expensive</p><p>- VPN lets child bypass web filter</p><p>- Untracked social media</p><p>- Android monitoring requires sideloading.</p><p><br/></p><p>When monitoring today&#39;s connected children, a parental control program that it can only use on the home computer is essentially useless. Qustodio is equipped with virtually every function that might be desired by a worried parent, such as web content filtering, powerful app banning, and a comprehensive activity record. You can handle all settings and monitoring through either the web dashboard of Qustodio or the parental feature of its mobile applications. This allows you to set rules and evaluate your child&#39;s activities from every location.</p><p>Qustodio has been in the business of providing parental controls for almost a decade at this point, and the company continues to expand both the comprehensive feature set that it offers and the range of platforms that it supports.</p><p>It is only rivaled by Net Nanny when it concerns overall platform coverage due to its compatibility with Ios, Android, Windows, macOS, Kindle tablets, and perhaps most recently, Chrome OS. This makes it a formidable candidate in the race for the top spot.</p><p>With such a few notable exclusions for iOS users, Qustodio also ranks among the solutions that offer the most comprehensive set of features currently available. While Qustodio&#39;s prices can add up quickly if you need to protect more than five devices, their entry-level premium plan for five devices costs just $54.95 per year, which is on par with the market average.</p><p><br/></p><h2><br/></h2><h2><br/></h2><h2><br/></h2><h2><br/></h2>",

The good news is that Net Nanny has evolved from its original purpose as an internet filter to include features that restrict a child's access to specific applications and limit their screen time. These features are fully functional, and the web filter is significantly less susceptible to bypasses than in our previous reviews. However, it now provides only rudimentary geofencing options. In addition, rivals offer a better value overall by covering a more significant number of devices in their plans.</p><p>The standard set of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, as well as Amazon's Fire OS (Kindle), are all supported by Net Nanny. Please be aware that Net Nanny has two mobile apps available. You'll need to use the first one to set up parental controls and monitor your child's device. Net Nanny is a web-based interface where you can modify settings. Qustodio and Safe Kids match their platform support. In contrast to Norton Family Premier, which can assist parents whose children use macOS laptops, Mobicip goes further by supporting Chromebooks.</p><p>Regarding app management systems, Net Nanny is among the best we've seen. This program is among the few that can monitor a child's device and notify parents whenever their youngster installs a new app. To help you make an informed decision, Net Nanny provides a summary of the app and links to its App Advisor page, where you can read more about the app's advantages and disadvantages.</p><p><br/></p>",

That makes it far cheaper than its main competitors. However, there are a few essential things that some parents might miss out on. This app employs a preventative strategy toward cyberbullying by allowing users to set their keywords and phrases.</p><p>By using pre-set categories of crucial terms and phrases plus adding their words or phrases, parents can further configure Surfie to give notifications when specific themes are violated. If these are used during chat logs, communication is shut off, alerts or transcripts are delivered to the parent's device, and the parent can review the issue and decide whether to let the child remain using the app or stop the app.</p><p>Surfie employs text-tracking algorithms to spot slang and identify cases of child filter-evasion strategies such as character substitution for numerals, phonetic spelling, and character omission. In most cases, Surfie can pick up on any conversation and report to you.</p><p>Suppose your children spend a lot of time using messaging applications like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram. In that case, you should seriously consider installing Surfie so that you can keep tabs on their conversations.</p><p>The rest of the tool's functions are standard and adequate. Like other parental control apps, it includes filters to restrict access to inappropriate material in 18 categories. These categories cover the gamut from alcohol and gambling to sexual content and hate speech.</p><p><br/></p>",

Additionally, alerts are delivered rapidly, albeit location services may require work. Overall, we rated Bark's efficiency as an 8. Many people (especially young people) have complained about how slow apps became after installing Bark. Our testing revealed no significant slowdowns in the performance of the tested apps or the tested devices. The number of apps being tracked and the age of the device are both factors.</p><p>Currently, Bark can monitor 32 different applications, games, email accounts, or internet browsers, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. You will be notified whenever your child's content or behavior is deemed inappropriate.</p><p>Even if your child sends an emoji of a beer cup in a text message, Bark will send you an alert. If your youngster sends their buddies something like \"I'm terribly depressed,\" you will know. To accomplish this, Bark employs a set of machine learning algorithms technology that draws upon linguistic and contextual cues.</p><p>Even when using a browser like Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge in private mode, Bark can still see what you're doing online. In any case, your mileage may vary depending on the gadget you use. For example, Bark can only spy on iOS devices running Chrome.</p><p>Web sites, search queries, and Email can all be blocked by Bark. Email monitoring, in particular, has shown to be a reliable tool for us. Bark examines all incoming and outgoing emails and any files attached to them. From the parent dashboard, you may easily access the content that has been marked.</p><p><br/></p>",

Modern technology has allowed kids of all ages to use electronic gadgets for anything from entertainment and education to schoolwork and chores. There is rising anxiety over how much time children spend glued to screens because of how ubiquitous they have become in their daily lives. According to reports, the typical kid consumes seven hours daily in front of electronic screens. That's far longer than what the AAP suggests.</p><p><br/></p><p>It's not easy to strike a healthy balance with screen time, despite its many benefits. For example, the internet was a vital social tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and is an invaluable educational tool for today's schoolchildren. Thankfully, there are apps available to assist parents limit and monitoring their children's screen time. Some apps even allow you to monitor your child's internet activity, restrict their access to inappropriate material, and even prohibit specific apps from being used.</p>",
