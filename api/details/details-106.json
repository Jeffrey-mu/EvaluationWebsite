Many people who spend their days at an office know that sitting for long periods is bad for your health. As a bookkeeper at quite a company or a communications expert working on a marketing strategy and 20 hours of training, sitting for lengthy periods may generate difficulties, including back and neck aches. The first kneeling chair was designed in 1979 by Peter Opsvik or Hans Christian Mengshoel. Eventually, the term \"ergonomics\" would become more precisely defined. Put them together, and you have yourself some much-needed relief.</p><p><br></p><p>However, not all kneeling chairs are created equal. There are many different solutions available to fulfill your requirements, so don't settle for anything that doesn't quite fit. Read on to learn the kneeling chairs we recommend.The high price and limited sitting alternatives were major turn offs for us, but we appreciated the latter's physical activity promotion. When it comes to office chairs, this same Varier Variable Plus seems to be in a class of its own. This kneeling chair is a welcome departure from the standard issue black and gray leatherette chairs that may be seen in most waiting rooms. Is it a marketing ploy, or do you genuinely find it cozy?</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Kneeling Chair Varier Variable Plus is an excellent alternative office chair choice for individuals who are struggling with back troubles; however, it does come with a somewhat steep price tag.</b></p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+ Inspires you to be more active.</p><p>+ Numerous opportunities for personalization.</p><p>+ The number of available seats is high.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>- Expensive.</p><p>- No sizing options; single size fits all.</p><p>- Very slow to get familiar with.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Specifications:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><b>Chair Measurement:</b>  20.47 x 28.4 x 20 inches</p><p><b>Box Measurement:</b><b>  </b>4 x 15 x 15 inches</p><p><b>Weight incl box:</b>  15 pounds</p><p><b>Brand:  </b>Varier</p><p><b>Material</b><b>:  </b>Birch</p><p><b>Product Dimensions</b><b>:  </b>14\"D x 14\"W x 28\"H</p><p><br></p><h2><b>What Is A Chair For Kneeling?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433779420.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>To use a kneeling chair, you, you guessed it, kneel rather than sit. To reach its eponymous posture, the user leans forward on an inclined seat and rests their shins on two cushions. My kneeling chair is a traditional style with a wooden rocking base, while the entire thing was created with the user in mind so that it's easy to make modifications. The word \"variable balans,\" meaning variable balance, hints at the kneeling chair's central principle of mobility. Kneelers are designed to move around once they find a comfortable and balanced posture and when that position becomes unnaturally fixed.</p><p><br></p><p>For long periods, \"any position seems inappropriate, even the kneeling posture,\" explains Norwegian design company Peter Opsvik, developer of either the kneeling chair, through an interview on Pure Contemporary. Kneeling is simply one of many possible chair positions. Therefore I ensured that all of my \"balance\" chairs were designed with that in mind. The two shin cushions allow you to adjust the kneeling chair to various settings. Unlike other chairs, this one allows you to adjust the seat's height to suit your needs while seated. Your shins may rest on the cushions, or you can put one foot, two very different feet, or neither foot on the ground.</p><p><br></p><p>Some believe that since a kneeling chair places the user's whole weight on their knees, those with knee issues should not use it. In contrast, kneeling chairs still transfer part of your body weight to your butt and shins rather than your knees. Avoid avoiding the term \"balance\" as much as possible. Your core, but instead, back muscles will be engaged more than they would be in a regular chair, but you won't feel like you're walking a tightrope.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>What Are The Convenience Of Using A Kneeling Chair?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433787251.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>We are more sedentary as a society than ever before; the average office worker today sits for up to 15 hours a day, contributing to the epidemic of obesity, heart disease, depression, and premature mortality. These seats help your back, neck, and shoulders achieve their natural posture, relieving pressure on your spine and relieving stress on your lower back, even though kneeling isn't quite as healthy as standing all day. The forward tilt of the pelvis brought about by the kneeling chair facilitates improved respiratory and gastrointestinal function and improves posture and pressure. This means more oxygen and nutrients are carried throughout the body, increasing vitality, mental clarity, and focus.</p><p><br></p><p>As previously noted, maintaining your equilibrium on this chair will force you to use your core and shoulder muscles, preventing them from weakening with time. Unlike a regular chair, the body must provide its own support when sitting in a kneeling chair.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Introducing The Ergonomic Kneeling Chair By Variable Balans</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433798532.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The Variable Balans, launched at the 1979 Scandinavia Woodworking Fair with Norwegian manufacturer Peter Opsvik, revolutionized Scandinavian design by prioritizing use above aesthetics. Famous for its simplicity (think Ikea), the Scandinavian design reduces an item to its barest essentials. Opsvik maintained that minimalism was quite different from functionality, even though the original inventors of that kind of style were called \"functionalists.\"</p><p><br></p><p>In an interview with Pure Contemporary, Opsvik says that when the form is prioritized above function, the resulting designs are typically difficult to use. My <b>chairs are comfortable</b> and designed for long hours of sitting. For his creations to serve their intended purpose, Opsvik first considers the necessities of the patient's psyche, allowing form to follow naturally. If there's anything Opsvik knows for sure, it's just that the humans were not intended to sit around doing anything.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>The Benefits Of Using A Kneeling Chair That Offers Adjustable Balancing</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433809127.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>This chair did help my back, and I'm not exaggerating. From what I can tell from doing some research online, I'm not alone. Now that I've discovered the secret to proper posture and can rock and readjust as much as necessary throughout the workday, I get pain relief and increased alertness. My work chair may have been purely functional for Opsvik, but I couldn't be happier with its appearance. This design is Scandinavian; its minimalistic elegance complements my home office and bedroom. It doesn't seem commercial or cumbersome. It can be stored away neatly beneath my desk when not in use, and its lack of wheels means it won't ridicule my lack of room or damage my carpet. It's reasonable to assume that the builder of this chair gave thought to every possible feature, even to the Allen wrench stashed beneath the seat for future tightening.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>What's Not To Like About The Variable Balancing Act The Kneeling Chair</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433819525.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>The Variable Balans kneeling chair isn't adjustable like those made by Office Star, DRAGON, or VIVO. Therefore it may not be suitable for those with long legs or a heavy frame. For a chair with a price tag of $379–$449, I was especially disheartened to see the forest nap cloth pilling after just two months of usage. It's also worth noting that the wooden rocker makes a lot of noise whenever you readjust it.</p><p><br></p><p>It's also important to note that it could feel strange the first few days of utilizing this chair. My IT band, shins, and thighs hurt the first few days I spent kneeling, but that's to be expected with any new posture or action. If you're not used to this new manner of sitting, it's best to ease into it by alternating periods of kneeling, standing, and (heaven forbid) traditional chair sitting.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>The Variable Balance Of The Decision From A Kneeling Chair</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433833546.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>After sitting in this chair, I can confidently say that Variable Balans chairs are the way to go. Its kneeling chair would be universal and tailored to your body and sitting habits due to its ergonomic design and high-quality construction. My back problems vanished, and I discovered the simple pleasures of sitting unexpectedly, both hallmarks of Scandinavian design. And if you've been considering purchasing Variable Balans, now is the time to do it since they are now at a 21% discount on Amazon.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Support</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>Improving your posture is the only reason to consider replacing your regular office chair with a kneeling one. Because of its design, such a kneeling chair makes it much simpler to maintain postural stability, which in turn helps your spine retain its natural form and curve while seated. This is why most individuals choose an ergonomically correct chair with an adjustable back and lumbar support. Like the Balans chair, the new DRAGON (formerly VIVO) Anatomical Kneeling Chair allows you to kneel while working. However, it doesn't have a rocking feature for when you become fatigued.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Comfort</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>This same Varier Adjustable Kneeling Chair differs from the Sleekform Kneeling Recliner in that it has two individual knee pads rather than a single large cushion. When it comes to the level of comfort, it is purely subjective. Therefore we can't say much more than that. Check out our VON racing driver massage gaming chair review if you're in the market for a device that will alleviate your back pain.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Adjustability</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>Much like the Steelcase Sequence office chair, the Varier Housing and real estate Kneeling Chair has no height adjustment options, which is a major drawback. Some potential critics start to seem more convincing when you include the advantages of competing solutions, such as the Sleekform Kneeling Chair. In this example, proponents of something like the Housing and real estate kneeling chair could argue that, since it encourages active sitting by using your core muscles, it mitigates the harmful consequences of static sitting.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Value</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>Norway-based furniture and office supply manufacturer Varier cares about its customers' health and happiness. Their seats are comfortable, with the possible exception of their price. The Balans chair, for instance, starts at $300, while Sleek Form Lying on the ground Posture Chair sells for about $124. To justify its high price tag, this same Varier Balans chair offers a complimentary roll of soft tape to protect your floors from scratches, and it's available in as many as five distinct colors. We liked black Black Revive Fabric made from natural ash best, but you're welcome to try any of the five.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Who Would Benefit From Sitting On A Kneeling Chair?</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433840041.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>A kneeling chair will be a lifesaver if you have back problems and bad posture. Because of how they're made, sitting in one for long periods is less likely to tighten your hip flexors and cause back pain than sitting in a <b>conventional office chair</b>. You may rotate between a regular chair and a kneeling chair if you notice that sitting in the first for extended amounts of time causes discomfort.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>Its Varier Dimension Balans crouching chair is among the few contemporary models that remain faithful to the design of Peter Opsvik's 1979 original kneeling chair. Many would still maintain that it is the finest ergonomic kneeling chair available today, and they would be quite correct. For a good reason, this same Varier Movable Balans chair looks quite different from standard contemporary kneeling chairs.
