A new over-the-range &#40;OTR&#41; microwave may be purchased for as low as $200 &#40;not counting installation costs, which can add another $100 or more&#41;. If the price of your new microwave is above a particular threshold, some stores, like Home Depot, will install it for free. The downsides should not be ignored, however. Even while over-the-range microwaves include an exhaust fan, they are not as effective at removing odors and fumes from the kitchen as range hoods. Also, if your microwave is more than 18 inches above your stove, you could have trouble reaching it to retrieve a steaming cup of soup.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671424164135.jpeg","content_id":"204,312,313,314,315","author_id":"7","release_time":"2022-10-12 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-19 12:30:46","update_time":"2022-12-20 19:03:10","entered_by":"admin","topping":"0","score":"","author_introduction":"Lucas Jones is the Technical Editor for Top Ten Reviews.

A chainsaw may be the perfect instrument for the task whether you need to trim overgrown hedges, stray tree branches, or other landscape timbers; remove debris from storm damage, or perform demolition before reconstruction. The best chainsaws would not necessarily have to be huge, noisy, or run on gasoline. My research and personal experience tell me.

Credit counseling and monitoring services are accessible throughout your trial period. You may cancel at whatever time with no fees if you aren't happy with the service.

Customers often see a score improvement of 53–187 points, although this range is not guaranteed. Customers may usually expect to see improvements within 60 days.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Always-Up-to-Date Credit Reports</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>Even though you may get your credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com, each agency only allows you to see your account once each year. The Credit People gives you continuous information from the big three agencies about your credit records.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Issues with Credit Reports</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>These same Credit People will intervene on your behalf to dispute inaccurate information in personal credit reports, including accounts that are not yours or statements that are shown as delinquent but have been paid in full. Those negative items will disappear from personal credit reports if the business succeeds.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Elimination of Past-Due Fees</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671504893700.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>If you have late payments shown on your credit reports, The Credit People can negotiate with your creditors to remove them. Even though your compensation is 30 or 120 days late, the corporation claims they will still try to collect from you.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Validation of Debt</b><b></b></h3><p><br></p><p>The Credit People will verify your debts and make sure they are yours by issuing debt validation letters.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Optional Add-Ons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>Credit People doesn't provide add-on services like other organizations, such as protection against identity theft or helping improve a company's credit score.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Company Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671504908741.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Here are some of the services provided by The Credit People:</p><p><br></p><p>● When you join up, you'll get a free foreclosure assistance consultation over the phone with a specialist to go through existing credit reports, including credit scores.</p><p>● Having your online account with The Credit People, you can keep tabs on your credit score.</p><p>● If you aren't happy with the service, cancel anywhere, and we'll give you a full refund, including the cost of the current and prior months.</p><p>● The Credit People's website is an excellent resource for learning resources, including articles on improving your credit score.</p><p>● By law, credit repair agencies are not allowed to have positive, timely, and verifiable information deleted from your credit reports. Recent and verifiable payment failures or late payments cannot be erased.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Customer Support</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>Unlike several of its competitors in the credit repair industry, The Credit People does not maintain a 24/7 customer service presence. Customer care representatives are accessible during regular business hours only (Monday through Friday, 9 am to 5 pm). In addition to an available toll-free number (866) 382-3410, you can also reach customer service through email. The firm has a TrustScore of 2.8 out of 5, which is visible on Trustpilot, despite its wide range of customer reviews. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of ways to provide input.</p><p><br></p><p>The product's effectiveness and the fact that it can't be returned for a refund have both been criticized in recent reviews. This firm was hauled before the House Public procurement And Disposal Services after receiving over 400 complaints (CFPB). Customers complained about Credit People's excessive prices, poor response times from customer service representatives, and the ineffectiveness of the company's products. Many customers complained about the company's inefficient customer support. Although there are not many negative reviews or comments posted online, people should still use care and make sure they read everything before making a decision.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cost</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>The Credit People provide a free trial period of seven days. If you like what you see and want to join up after the trial period ends, you have two choices:</p><p><br></p><p>● We charge $79 monthly plus $19 for the first consultation.</p><p>● On the flat-rate plan, one payment of $419 gets you six months of service (or around $70 a month).</p><p>● A twenty-dollar discount is available for couples. Your spouse's enrollment must be valid within three days of your original purchase.</p><p>● There is a guarantee of satisfaction offered by The Credit People. If you pay monthly, The Credit People might prorate your refund for the current and prior months if you cancel before the end of the month. A full six months of protection is provided for individuals who choose the flat-rate plan.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Choosing the Right Credit Repair Service</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671504929393.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>Take into account the following criteria while selecting a credit repair agency:</p><p><br></p><p>● Costs are different for each organization. To begin with, there may be an upfront setup price, a recurring monthly fee, and a cancellation fee. Add-on services may potentially incur more expenses.</p><p>● Depending on the company, you may only be able to contact a customer care representative during regular business hours, while others are accessible around the clock. If you work nights, it's essential to know the hours of a credit repair firm. Consultations and queries can't be answered or scheduled without this information.</p><p>● Contrast the credit repair organizations that ask you to sign contracts with others that provide monthly payments with no long-term commitment.</p><p>● Credible credit repair services offer transparent refund policies and will return your payment if you are unhappy with their work.</p><p>● Debt management programs, identity fraud monitoring, and identity theft insurance are just a few of the extra options that some firms provide.</p><p>● When it comes to your credit, no firm can promise you anything. Warning signs include claims of guaranteed results or guaranteed improvements in your credit score.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Alternative Options</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>It would help if you never decided without first carefully weighing all of your available alternatives. Researchers compared This Particular Credit To Individuals to National Credit Pros, another organization operating in the <b>credit repair industry</b> widely acknowledged as among the most reputable companies in the area. The Credit People's rates are lower than those of The Credit Pros. However, they only provide a fraction of the services they appear to be available now. The Credit Pros provides a more all-encompassing option because of its higher price tag and extensive features, such as identity theft protection and budgeting assistance.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of this, it's an attractive choice for customers. The Credit Pros' premium services come at a price, but those extra benefits might be well worth it. Among the many benefits offered by The Credit Pros, the availability of a powerful mobile app that allows users to track their own progress and have two-way conversations with the company's support team stands out.</p><p>Process of Evaluating Credit Repair CompaniesOur research researched and analyzed over 600 data points across 17 credit repair organizations. We used a weighted system to give more importance to the 39 factors consumers told us were most important to them.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>We narrowed it down to these top options by considering:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671504942289.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\"></p><p><br></p><p>● Expenses and charges (40.5 percent of the total)</p><p>● Provided Services (35%).</p><p>● Perception by Customers (22.5%)</p><p>● Confidence (3%)</p><p>● We considered the expected monthly volume of conflicts, the nature of those complaints, cancellation and refund policies, and the time a company has been operating. Your company's star rating system and top recommendations relied on this data.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>Customers who sign up for one of its programs may see their credit report and credit score and file an unlimited number of disputes, all at no cost. In addition, you can count on The Credit People for thorough assistance every step of the journey. Prices and results from credit repair services might vary widely. The Credit People was created in 2001 to give people with terrible credit a reason to have faith in the future by showing them that a higher credit score is within their reach. The Credit People, a reputable credit restoration service, has been around for a long time and offers two different membership plans: a monthly fee plan and a one-time fee plan. As part of membership benefits, members may file as many disputes as they want, communicate with their creditors at any time, and get toll-free assistance. Please note that perhaps the credit repair firm provides a special discount for couples.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","amazon_adv":[]}]}
