A new over-the-range (OTR) microwave may be purchased for as low as $200 (not counting installation costs, which can add another $100 or more). If the price of your new microwave is above a particular threshold, some stores, like Home Depot, will install it for free. The downsides should not be ignored, however. Even while over-the-range microwaves include an exhaust fan, they are not as effective at removing odors and fumes from the kitchen as range hoods. Also, if your microwave is more than 18 inches above your stove, you could have trouble reaching it to retrieve a steaming cup of soup.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671424164135.jpeg","content_id":"657,204,312,313,314,315,783","author_id":"7","release_time":"2022-10-12 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-19 12:30:46","update_time":"2022-12-23 11:11:54","entered_by":"admin","topping_state":"0","topping_title":"null","score":"","author_introduction":"Lucas Jones is the Technical Editor for Top Ten Reviews.

The excitement might wilt out quickly if the grill isn't up to snuff. To help you maintain the good times (and the food), we've searched for gas grills that are resilient, simple to clean, and straightforward to use. Our study and experience with seven of the best grills on the market and many more led us to conclude that the Weber Spirit II E-310 is the best option for grilling meat and poultry. Its performance, convenience, longevity, and cost-effectiveness are unparalleled among grills.

It has one of the greatest capacities of any microwave we've tested, making it a good choice for households with many people or for individuals who often use their microwave to heat large trays or plates. However, at the cost of roughly $500, it is far more costly than the devices we've previously tested. Please continue reading to determine whether we believe it's a good investment. The LG LMHM2237ST over-the-range microwave is among the most expensive options we considered, but it offers a lot of useful functions for its price. To begin, let's talk about how much stuff you can store. With a spacious interior measuring 2.2 cubic feet, this microwave is the largest we looked at.</p><p>The LG LMHM2237ST's 1000 kW electric electricity is about par for the course; the cheaper Samsung ME16K3000AS offers the same amount of juice. This over-the-range microwave, however, stands out thanks to its variable speed fan. When compared to the other models, we looked at. The LG LMHM2237ST stands out because of its 400 CFM fan speed.</p><p>The LG LMHM2237ST has strong ventilation, known as ExtendaVent 2.0, which is designed to remove smells and fumes from the cooktop underneath it. This ventilation system is meant to be low-noise so as not to be too annoying. The LG LMHM2237ST has ten touch-controlled power settings, but its Sensor Cook feature is where it shines. The sensor in the cooktop measures the moisture emanating from the meal. This microwave will automatically shut off when the desired moisture content is reached, preventing either overcooking or drying out of your food.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"4.5","subtitle":"Best over-the-range microwaves ","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":312,"content":"<h2><hr><p><br></p></h2><h2><b>2.

The GE JVM3160RFSS is a high-end over-the-range microwave that almost makes our top picks list. Similar to the Samsung ME16K3000AS (opens in new tab), but at a lower price point, this microwave includes a two-speed fan that operates at 300 cubic feet per minute (CFM).</p><p>The microwave's quick-cook features set it apart from other models placed over the stove. The six numbered buttons enable you to start a cycle of any length between one and six minutes with the press of a single button. This is definitely an improvement compared to its rivals, which only featured three rapid cook buttons. Even if you don't plan on eating the food immediately, the warm power option will preserve it at a safe temperature until you're ready. That won't replace the official warm and hold button, but it will do in a pinch.</p><p>With the microwaves we looked at, only the GE JVM3160RFSS offers customization in terms of color and finish. We've emphasized the sleek stainless steel finish seen here, but you may also choose from four additional colors to find the perfect complement to your kitchen's aesthetic. The clock and non-stick interior are two more noteworthy design elements.
