In a nutshell, it's the same thing. The Logitech logo has been given a more prominent placement near the lens in the redesigned 2015 design, moving it from the bottom right corner. In addition to that, You can't think of many significant distinctions. A little black rectangle sits in the top right corner of your display. There is one lens in the middle that looks out and two microphones that angle inward. Safe to listen to, though a little monotonous. Given the frequency with which Logitech has updated its peripherals, I anticipated a more radical makeover of the C922; instead, the company has taken the \"if it ain't broke, don't repair it\" approach.</p><p><br></p><p>The mount utilizes the same L-shaped mouth as the C920, with the extra weight dangling off the back of the screen. The C922 has a more extended lip than the Stargazer, which may be an annoyance for those whose monitors have very narrow bezels. The alternative is to use a tripod to support the C922; although a full-size tripod would be ideal, if you buy from Best Buy, Logitech will throw in a tiny tripod that expands to roughly seven inches in height. It's not terrible, but the angle at it took pictures while sitting on my desk highlighted my chin and nose. If you have a suitable arrangement, placing it on a shelf or perhaps on the top of a high computer speaker would be optimal.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing I would have liked to see improved by<b> Logitech</b> in the past four years is the quality of the rubber cable used to connect your camera to the computer. Unfortunately, it hasn't gone away. It's not something I can swap out, it's thin and rubberized, and I live in constant fear of squishing it and ruining my camera. This seems incredibly obnoxious, given that Razer's Stargazer comes with a robust, fabric-encased, and detachable cord. Razer's choice is a little cumbersome and rigid, but at least it's durable.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Design","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":1013,"content":"<p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433486138.png\" alt=\"\"><br></p><p><br></p><p>The C922 doesn't have a lot of configuration options. The webcam is fastened to the tripod by threading the metal ring onto the top of something like the swivel mount and bringing it up to meet the camera. Tripod legs may be extended to the necessary height, and the rotation can be secured by using the tiny plastic loop upon that side. Just connect the camera to a computer's USB connection, launch the desired program, and choose the C922 as the video and audio source. We usually rely on written reviews and photographs when evaluating a product. Still, as this is a webcam assessment, we decided, what the heck, let's produce a cringeworthy movie to show off the C922's capabilities right out of the box.</p><p><br></p><p>The following video was captured solely using C922 with no prior preparation other than blocking off part of the house's light to test the automated low light correction capability. In this video, we assess the C922's low-light capabilities, the resolution and frame rate options, the quality of the audio captured by the camera versus that captured by a headset microphone, and finally, the background replacement option. Watch the video or read on for a summary of our findings.</p><p><br></p><p>Automatic low-light environment correction is a fantastic option for individuals who lack the space or funds for dedicated illumination. The function made my skin tone seem more natural in the test video since it brightened the backdrop and reduced the glare first from the screen. Even though we filmed our clip during the day, we tried filming it at night only using desk lighting and saw a significant difference. Although low light correction shouldn't be used instead of a dedicated lighting system, we anticipate that bedside streamers should utilize this functionality extensively.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Setup and Verification","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":1014,"content":"<h2><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1671433497340.png\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" alt=\"\"><br></h2><p><br></p><p>Logitech has advertised the C922 with a wide variety of functions. For example, streaming at 720p at 60 frames a second is a vast improvement. One more is the ability to remove the backdrop automatically. Despite this, the C922 boasts something much more fundamental going for it: you pull it straight from the box, switch it in, and the image looks decent. To save costs, Logitech could have omitted Stargazer's core RealSense technology, which enables features like gesture tracking, visual processing, infrared, and 3D scanning. Some of the missing pieces are especially painful to ignore. The C922 doesn't support Windows Hello, and Logitech's background removal isn't nearly as effective as RealSense's hardware-backed approach. Both photographs were shot with both the lights off. Therefore my face is lit solely by my monitor.</p><p><br></p><p>The C920's widespread success may be attributed, in part, to the fact that it produces high-quality photos for under $100. My coworker Michael Ansaldo included it as part of a webcam roundup and described the image quality as \"shockingly sharp.\" The C922 continues and improves upon that tradition, with improved low-light performance as a key selling point. While this may not be a significant selling point for businesses, it will undoubtedly be appreciated by the younger generation of Twitch broadcasters who have been streaming from their beds. The problem is that the C920 was utterly worthless for video at any of those settings, so don't get your hopes up too high. The camera's frame rate was reduced to between 5 and 10 fps to maintain sharpness. With just the display for illumination, the C922 can achieve 30 fps.</p><p><br></p><p>The C922 is the most excellent camera you can purchase for use with services like Skype, Google Hangouts, and others. Could Logitech have made an even more significant effort? Is it strange that there aren't higher-resolution consumer cameras than 1080p yet? Maybe. Even the Stargazer, which Logitech's competitors can't match, maxes out at 1080p. The smartphone market has advanced far faster than the webcam market. Let's be frank, too: Users who are ready to spend a hundred bucks on a camera are probably making videos for Twitch or YouTube, where the <b>C922's primary function</b> is to output a 200200-pixel vignette of a user's face in the middle corner of the LCD screen. The 720p resolution should be acceptable for that purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>Another critical function of the C922 is background elimination without needing a green screen. The C920 has the software capabilities to do this (with TriDef SmartCam, for example), but the C922 has Personify ChromaCam pre-installed. It's important to emphasize that this is yet another software-based answer. The Stargazer uses Intel's RealSense technology, which has depth-perception capabilities, as I described before. The Stargazer can tell how far away an object is from the camera, which it utilizes to blur out the backdrop. Instead, \"Intelligent Shape Recognition\" from Personify is used by the C922. Here, we don't have any clever depth-sensing technology. It scans the scene for what it believes is a person in the foreground and deletes the rest of the background information (with varying degrees of success).</p><p><br></p><p>Hair. This is the C922's weak spot. When using the C922, even in the best lighting conditions, it often snips random chunks of hair or shaves off my cheek when I tilt my head to one side. Software-based background removal has had this problem since it was implemented. The Stargazer is not only superior in terms of still images but also much quicker. Compared to the C922/Personify, which occasionally blacked out my hand over my face, the Stargazer was so much more consistent at acknowledging the edges of many objects, quicker at doing so, but quicker to notice if anything really moved in front of another camera.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Those Results are Promising","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":1015,"content":"<p>When compared to previous models, the C922 doesn't provide a very significant improvement. It's the same camera that Logitech introduced in 2012. The fact that Logitech needed to release the C922 to remain competitive indicates how slowly the camera business moves. Including 720p/60fps streaming functionality, improved low-light performance, and simple background removal seem to be the cherry on top for an already dominant product in its field. So don't write off the Stargazer just yet. The Stargazer may have more extended longevity than the C922 if Intel and Razer successfully get developers to use the RealSense platform. However, it is enormous because it only applies to a small subset of the population. The C922 has the finest picture quality of any webcam currently available.<br></p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Conclusion","amazon_adv":[]}]}
