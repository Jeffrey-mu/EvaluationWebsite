Our model was protected from the sun and the rain by an excellent quality cover given to us by Weber. It has been raining on several occasions, and has done an excellent job of protecting the gear each time. It is a cover of industrial strength and has four Velcro straps to assist it in place even when the wind is blowing.</p><p><br></p><p>The grill is on four wheels, allowing you to easily move it about your patio area and store it away in a secure location when it is not in use. This is especially useful if you have a big garage or shed.</p><p><br></p><p>It shouldn't be too difficult to clean the grates; Weber suggests using a barbeque brush with stainless steel bristles. On the other hand, the Flavorizer bars should be wiped with a plastic scraper, so they don't become damaged. When cleaning the burners, you may use a bristle brush made of stainless steel, and when cleaning the spider screens, you can use a bristle brush made of soft bristles.</p><p><br></p><p>When cleaning the components made of stainless steel, you should use a stainless steel cleaner that is not abrasive and wipe them down with a soft cloth. Using anything more abrasive will result in scratches. It is recommended that warm, soapy water be used to clean the enameled portions of the grill. The following method, suggested by Dan Cooper, is what you should do to clean your gas grill:</p><p><br></p><p>· Disconnecting gas tank is the first step in cleaning your gas barbecue; please refer to the owner's handbook with your particular model for further instructions.</p><p>· The next step is to use a brush to remove any food particles from grates, spray grate cleaner, and let it sit for a minute.</p><p>· After that, clean the grate by scrubbing it with the abrasive side of your sponge, then rinsing it with water and setting it aside to dry.</p><p>· Spray the grate cleanser over the Flavorizer bars and the inside of the cook box, then wait thirty seconds for the spray to settle. Remove the oil and debris from the Flavorizer bars with a plastic scraper, then place the bars in a separate bowl and clean them using a sponge.</p><p>· Scrub the inside of the cook box, the drip tray, and the bottom tray; use a brush as required. Take special care not to get water on the burner tubes at any time.</p><p>· Before you reassemble your grill and finish the grates by spraying them with a non-stick spray, check to see that your barbeque has completely dried off.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Performance","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":847,"content":"<p>· $1,699 / £1,999<br></p><p><br></p><p>The computerized dashboard, lighting, and connection push the price of Weber's newest flagship model, which is also their most expensive model.
