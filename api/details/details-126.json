In addition to the three main burners, it also contains a &#34;bonus&#34; burner that controls the &#34;Sear Zone,&#34; which allows you to produce the wonderful barbeque grilled caramelization characteristic of grilled meat. There is a side burner for heating beans or corn, as well as cooking potatoes, and there are lots of settings for ultimate control, which makes this grill great for anybody who is truly interested in cooking more than just a few burgers for friends and family.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Pros</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>+\tExcellent workmanship throughout, as well as an aesthetically pleasing design.</p><p>+\tA remarkable level of craftsmanship and superiority in the materials used.</p><p>+\tSimple and step-by-step construction with accompanying instructions.</p><p>+\tEnormous in size, with a multitude of cooking places and enough space for food preparation</p><p>+\tOutstanding grilling performance in addition to a quick and simple operation</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>- Huge and difficult to move, particularly during the setup phase.</p><p>- Extremely high in cost.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Key Specs</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><b>Number Of Side Burners:</b> \t1</p><p><b>Number Of Main Burners:</b> \t3</p><p><b>Main Burner BTU:</b> \t48,000</p><p><b>Dimensions:</b><b> </b> 62 x 27 x 48.5 in</p><p><b>Weight:</b>  210 lbs.</p><p><b>Cooking Space:</b>  994 in</p><p><b>Burner Material:</b>  Stainless steel</p><p><b>Product Warranty:</b> \t12-year limited</p><p><b>Burner Warranty:</b> \t10 years</p><p><br/></p><p>The Weber Genesis EPX-335 is a gas-fired, Bluetooth- and WiFi-enabled centerpiece designed to take precedence on your patio. It is a BBQ behemoth and one of the two premium models in the complete, extended Genesis portfolio that Weber touted as &#34;the largest grilling innovation in decades,&#34; promising to deliver a whole outdoor gourmet experience.</p><p><br/></p><p>Even in its three-burner configuration, the Weber <b>Genesis</b> is a massive barbeque with a big cooking space and impressive power to generate searing heat consistently. It takes approximately two hours to put together, and you&#39;ll need to find a place to keep the enormous box it arrives in until you&#39;re done, but the sturdy construction gives the impression that it was made to stay.</p><p><br/></p><p>In addition to being very easy to use, it also has an ingenious grease management system that makes it very simple to clean. Furthermore, it has built-in intelligent capabilities that enable you to check the interior temperature of anything you are cooking on your phone. Because it has a wide variety of burners and other cooking surfaces, it can accommodate as few as two people or as many as twelve people with equal ease.</p><p><br/></p><p>Last but not least, the cabinet and outside shelves provide enormous room for storage and preparation. There are hooks to hang tools, and a separate locker is provided for any Weber Crafted accessories that you may already possess. In a nutshell, it dominates the world of outdoor barbecues, but its dominance comes at a price.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Design</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>It has a really elegant appearance; nevertheless, just like any other stainless steel, it shows fingerprint smudges quite readily; thus, you need always have some stainless steel cleaning on hand to keep it looking its best.</p><p><br/></p><p>The quality is obvious, as is the case with the majority of Weber models we evaluated; nevertheless, this results in the unit being somewhat weighty. Additionally, the hinged lid is rather heavy, which is something to keep in mind if you are not in the best physical condition.</p><p><br/></p><p>There are two side tables: a huge one on the right that provides a lot of room for preparing food and storing dishes and a smaller one on the left that, when lifted, reveals an additional gas burner. Both tables are located to the right of the main counter. If you want to reheat maize or beans and sauté some mushrooms or onions, this comes in very helpful.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Features</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The huge cooking area has four burners; yes, you read it correctly: four! The fourth one controls what Weber refers to as the Sear Zone; it is more powerful than the others, allowing you to get that great sear on your steak and other foods. In addition, there is a great deal of control available with this gas grill.</p><p><br/></p><p>To cook a whole chicken, for instance, you may switch on the burners on each side of the bird to shield it from the direct effect of the heat. A secondary grill is located above the primary cooking grates that may be used for preparing food that either does not need as much time to cook or tastes better when it is removed from the source of direct heat.</p><p><br/></p><p>The side tables have a lot of room, so you can use them to keep dishes or handle meal preparation, and there are six hooks on the side tables to hang different sorts of barbecue items. This particular Weber grill also contains something that Weber terms &#34;Flavorizer bars.&#34; When the fat from the meat drips down these bars, flames are created, which impart a more realistic &#34;barbecued&#34; flavor to the food cooked over a gas grill.</p><p><br/></p><p>In connection with grease, there is a practical drip tray holder that is included with disposable trays; nonetheless, we wiped the grease off them and washed them in the dishwasher without any problems. You may need to replace them on time, but getting additional ones via internet shopping is simple.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Performance</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>It took some time to control the temperature on the grill since there are four burners to manage, each of which has its own temperature setting. Having said that, after we got used to the routine, we were impressed with how uniformly the food was cooked.</p><p><br/></p><p>It took a little over an hour for our entire chicken to finish cooking, and once it was done, it had a crispy top and was juicy and flavorful throughout. We got a beautiful pattern on our steaks thanks to the sear zone, and with a little bit more effort, we can see how you might make this grill live up to its full potential and make use of it all has to offer.</p><p><br/></p><p>Switch out the cooking grate on this model with the unique Weber grillwork, and you&#39;ll be able to do anything from bake, steam, roast, and even stir-fry in your outdoor kitchen in addition to grilling! This model is a complete outdoor kitchen in one convenient package.</p><p><br/></p><p>Because the Weber Genesis EPX-335 is a large piece of equipment that is also not inexpensive, you will want to safeguard your financial investment. Our model was protected from the sun and the rain by an excellent quality cover given to us by Weber. It has been raining on several occasions, and has done an excellent job of protecting the gear each time. It is a cover of industrial strength and has four Velcro straps to assist it in place even when the wind is blowing.</p><p><br/></p><p>The grill is on four wheels, allowing you to easily move it about your patio area and store it away in a secure location when it is not in use. This is especially useful if you have a big garage or shed.</p><p><br/></p><p>It shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to clean the grates; Weber suggests using a barbeque brush with stainless steel bristles. On the other hand, the Flavorizer bars should be wiped with a plastic scraper, so they don&#39;t become damaged. When cleaning the burners, you may use a bristle brush made of stainless steel, and when cleaning the spider screens, you can use a bristle brush made of soft bristles.</p><p><br/></p><p>When cleaning the components made of stainless steel, you should use a stainless steel cleaner that is not abrasive and wipe them down with a soft cloth. Using anything more abrasive will result in scratches. It is recommended that warm, soapy water be used to clean the enameled portions of the grill. The following method, suggested by Dan Cooper, is what you should do to clean your gas grill:</p><p><br/></p><p>· Disconnecting gas tank is the first step in cleaning your gas barbecue; please refer to the owner&#39;s handbook with your particular model for further instructions.</p><p>· The next step is to use a brush to remove any food particles from grates, spray grate cleaner, and let it sit for a minute.</p><p>· After that, clean the grate by scrubbing it with the abrasive side of your sponge, then rinsing it with water and setting it aside to dry.</p><p>· Spray the grate cleanser over the Flavorizer bars and the inside of the cook box, then wait thirty seconds for the spray to settle. Remove the oil and debris from the Flavorizer bars with a plastic scraper, then place the bars in a separate bowl and clean them using a sponge.</p><p>· Scrub the inside of the cook box, the drip tray, and the bottom tray; use a brush as required. Take special care not to get water on the burner tubes at any time.</p><p>· Before you reassemble your grill and finish the grates by spraying them with a non-stick spray, check to see that your barbeque has completely dried off.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Price</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>· $1,699 / £1,999</p><p><br/></p><p>The computerized dashboard, lighting, and connection push the price of Weber&#39;s newest flagship model, which is also their most expensive model. You might save between $300 and $400 by purchasing a Weber model comparable to the Weber Genesis S 325s but does not have a connection. This is a considerable amount of money.</p><p><br/></p><p>The Napoleon Rogue XT 525 BBQ Grill features 805 square inches of cooking space, a searing station, and a sear zone. If your budget can&#39;t go quite that far, you could cut your expenditure in half by purchasing this grill.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>User Reviews</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The Weber Genesis EPX-335 now has 4.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon, which is quite fortunate considering the price range at which it is sold since the vast majority of customer reviews are good. Many customers commented on the enormous dimensions of the box when it was delivered. They advised others that they would have to assemble the product immediately if they lacked a place to keep it, while others mentioned how long it took to put it together. Aside from that specific criticism, the majority of the reviews that we examined were favorable.</p><p><br/></p><p>The firebox is sturdy and lives up to expectations, but I feel that the bottom &#34;frame,&#34; if you can truly call it that, may be the first piece to break,&#34; said one of the reviewers. If you did not participate in the assembly, it is possible that you will not even notice this. It is a piece of sheet metal that has been cornered together and then fastened to the base and the grill box.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Should You Buy Weber Genesis EPX-335?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>If you divide the cost of Weber Genesis EPX-335 and divide it by the number of summers that it will be used for cooking, you will get an estimate of approximately $140 per year. This is because the grill is built to last and comes with a lengthy warranty, which contributes to its durability. We believe it is an investment that is well worth making if you are a serious griller who uses the barbecue not just on the weekends but also during the week and who enjoys experimenting with various cooking techniques.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>How Sustainable Is The Weber Genesis Series EPX-335?</b><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p>The various components of this grill are covered by a reliable guarantee that lasts anywhere from two to twelve years, depending on the item. It should be included as standard, given the price point.</p><p><br/></p><p>Using a cover would allow for the life of its outside components to be increased. Unfortunately, this is not included in the purchase, but purchasing it would be an investment that would be well worth the money.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"425","score":"4","amazon_adv":[{"id":425,"picture":"/uploadsImg/1671525801324.jpeg","title":"Weber Genesis EPX-335","original_price":"$1,699.00","actual_price":"$1,699.00","specifications":"","link":"https://amzn.to/3SdCLR4","description":""}]}]}
