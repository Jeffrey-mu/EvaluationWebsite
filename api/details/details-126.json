To help you maintain the good times (and the food), we've searched for gas grills that are resilient, simple to clean, and straightforward to use. Our study and experience with seven of the best grills on the market and many more led us to conclude that the Weber Spirit II E-310 is the best option for grilling meat and poultry.

Remove the oil and debris from the Flavorizer bars with a plastic scraper, then place the bars in a separate bowl and clean them using a sponge.</p><p>¬∑ Scrub the inside of the cook box, the drip tray, and the bottom tray; use a brush as required. Take special care not to get water on the burner tubes at any time.</p><p>¬∑ Before you reassemble your grill and finish the grates by spraying them with a non-stick spray, check to see that your barbeque has completely dried off.</p>","amazon_adv_id":"","score":"","subtitle":"Performance","amazon_adv":[]},{"id":847,"content":"<p>¬∑ $1,699 / ¬£1,999<br></p><p><br></p><p>The computerized dashboard, lighting, and connection push the price of Weber's newest flagship model, which is also their most expensive model.
