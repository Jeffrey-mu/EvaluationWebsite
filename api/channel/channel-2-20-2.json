If the price of your new microwave is above a particular threshold, some stores, like Home Depot, will install it for free. The downsides should not be ignored, however. Even while over-the-range microwaves include an exhaust fan, they are not as effective at removing odors and fumes from the kitchen as range hoods. Also, if your microwave is more than 18 inches above your stove, you could have trouble reaching it to retrieve a steaming cup of soup.",

The summertime is at its best when you can sit outside and enjoy the weather while munching on a juicy burger that has been seared to perfection. The excitement might wilt out quickly if the grill isn&#39;t up to snuff. To help you maintain the good times &#40;and the food&#41;, we&#39;ve searched for gas grills that are resilient, simple to clean, and straightforward to use. Our study and experience with seven of the best grills on the market and many more led us to conclude that the Weber Spirit II E-310 is the best option for grilling meat and poultry. Its performance, convenience, longevity, and cost-effectiveness are unparalleled among grills. ",
