Even while over-the-range microwaves include an exhaust fan, they are not as effective at removing odors and fumes from the kitchen as range hoods. Also, if your microwave is more than 18 inches above your stove, you could have trouble reaching it to retrieve a steaming cup of soup.","first_picture":"/uploadsImg/1671424164135.jpeg","content_id":"657,204,312,313,314,315,783","author_id":"7","release_time":"2022-10-12 00:00:00","insert_time":"2022-12-19 12:30:46","update_time":"2022-12-23 11:11:54","entered_by":"admin","topping_state":"0","topping_title":"null","score":"","author_introduction":"Lucas Jones is the Technical Editor for Top Ten Reviews.
